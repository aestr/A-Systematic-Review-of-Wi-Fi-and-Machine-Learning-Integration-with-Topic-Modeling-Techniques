Nowadays, it has become an attractive research subject due to growing demands on it. Several algorithms and techniques have been developed over the decades. One of the most cost-effective technique is Wi-Fi-based positioning systems. This technique is infrastructure-free and able to use existing wireless access points in public or private areas. These systems aim to classify user's location according to pre-defined set of grids. However, Wi-Fi signals could be affected by interference, blockage of walls and multipath effect which increases error of classification. In this study Deep Neural Networks and conventional machine learning classifiers are utilized to classify 22 squared grids which represent locations. Five primary Wireless Access Points (WAPs) were mounted indoor environment and 177 secondary WAPs are observed by Wi-Fi module. Dataset was created with using five primary and 177 secondary WAPs. The performance of proposed method was tested using Deep Neural Networks and machine learning classifiers. The results show that Deep Neural Network present the best performance as compared to machine learning classifiers. 95.45% accuracy was achieved by using five primary WAPs and 97.27% accuracy was achieved by using five primary and 177 secondary WAPs together for Deep Neural Network.","","978-1-7281-6376-5","10.1109/TSP49548.2020.9163548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9163548","Indoor Positioning;Deep Neural Networks;Classification;Wi-Fi","Machine learning;Biological neural networks;Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity;Machine learning algorithms;Classification algorithms","indoor navigation;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;radionavigation;wireless LAN","large-scale technologies;attractive research subject;cost-effective technique;public areas;private areas;Wi-Fi signals;multipath effect;deep neural networks;conventional machine learning classifiers;indoor environment;Wi-Fi module;177 secondary WAP;primary wireless access points;Wi-Fi based indoor positioning system;primary WAP","","2","","12","","11 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, AP locations can be estimated when enough number of location-labeled Wi-Fi fingerprints are obtained. Since manually collecting Wi-Fi fingerprints costs human labor, crowdsourcing approach is preferred. Crowdsourced Wi-Fi fingerprints usually need an additional step to tag a location label. The low accuracy of indirectly acquired location labels affects the result of AP location estimation. Therefore, some AP locations need to be discarded if the error of estimated AP location is high. To measure the error, it is necessary to survey the ground truth of AP location. Since surveying true AP locations also costs human labor, an error prediction method is helpful.

This method will also help medical resident to achieve competence and increase their performance. NN is probably the best model to simulate human brain decision making process. In this study, each input neuron used in the network will represent a decision output of a real physician biological neural network. Numerical values assigned to each neuron in the input layer represent measurable decisions made by each subject matter participants (resident students, fellows and physicians). The output layer represents an aided real time decision which incorporates all processed input values. Several hidden neural layers are also used to process and measure all the data in the network. In traditional schools, high learning performance is usually achieved by reducing the number of students or increasing the number of teachers in class. This proposed method will mimic or create a virtual class where the teachers will outnumber students.

Moreover, as a lot of indoor activities are conducted within concrete buildings with dense obstacles, localization methods that are able to provide accurate information with efficiency in such complex environments, is key to successful application of LBS. A variety of positioning technologies have been developed over the years. This paper has investigated and compared various machine learning methods for the prediction of locations based on RSS data. It introduces the recent development of RSS technology in indoor localization and further investigates the application of machine learning methods for location prediction. WIFI-based RSS methods address the challenges in indoor localization where GPS and sensor networks failed to solve. Machine learning models which predict location or coordinates generally achieve high accuracy. However, the choice of specific models depends on the environment setup. The application of RSS methods addresses the difficulties in localization in environments with obstacles. While significant improvement in accuracy can be achieved by machine learning techniques, the computational cost is still controllable with customization in environmental and device setup. The cost-benefit suggests further research in this area will be beneficial and potentially profitable for industrialization.","","978-1-6654-1790-7","10.1109/MLBDBI54094.2021.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9730949","RSS method;machine learning methods;RSS technology;Machine learning models","Location awareness;Computational modeling;Buildings;Machine learning;Predictive models;Mobile handsets;Data models","","","","","","16","","17 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared with previous methods of constructing the CSI image, the new kind of CSI image proposed is able to contain more channel information such as the angle of arrival (AoA), the time of arrival (TOA) and the amplitude. We construct three gray images by using phase differences of different antennas and amplitudes of different subcarriers of one antenna, and then merge them to form one RGB image. The localization method has off-line stage and on-line stage. In the off-line stage, the composed three-channel RGB images at training locations are used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) which has been proved to be efficient in image recognition. In the on-line stage, images at test locations are fed to the well-trained CNN model and the localization result is the weighted mean value with highest output values.

However, the main challenge in such approach lies in the ability of the system to discover the WiFi coverage for users who may need to offload their data. For this, the access network discovery and selection function (ANDSF) has been introduced by 3GPP to provide the mobile user equipment (UE) with the discovery information and the list of available WiFi hotspots. However, the current ANDSF discovery mechanism depends on the geographical location of the UE, which need to be accurately determined and continuously transmitted to the ANDSF server. In this paper, an enhanced ANDSF WiFi discovery technique is proposed and validated. The proposed technique is designed to use the reference signal received power (RSRP) information measured at UEs from their surrounding cellular base stations to build fingerprints for various WiFi hotspot areas. Based on the constructed fingerprints, the UE's WiFi coverage state can be identified using the proposed decision tree (DT) machine learning approach.

Typical LTE transmissions are contention-free and centrally controlled by the Base Station (BS). However, the wireless networks that work in unlicensed bands use contention-based protocols for channel access, which raise the need to derive an efficient and fair coexistence mechanism among different radio access networks. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism based on neural networks for the coexistence of an LTE-U BS in the unlicensed spectrum alongside with WiFi access points. Specifically, we model the problem in coexistence as a 2-Dimensions Hopfield Neural Network (2D-HNN) based optimization problem that aims to achieve fairness considering both the LTE-U data rate and the QoS requirements of WiFi networks. Using the energy function of 2D-HNNs, precise investigation of its minimization property can directly provide the solution of the optimization problem. Furthermore, the problem of allocating the unlicensed resources to LTE-U users is modeled as a 2D-HNN and its energy function is leveraged to allocate resources to LTE-U users based on their channel states. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm allows the LTE-U BS to work efficiently in the unlicensed spectrum while protecting the WiFi networks. Moreover, more than 90% fairness among the LTE-U users is achieved when allocating the unlicensed resources to LTE-U users based on the proposed algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2933323","National Research Foundation of Korea; Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2017R1A2A2A05000995); MSIT, South Korea, through the Grand Information Technology Research Center Support Program supervised by the Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)(grant numbers:IITP-2018-2015-0-00742); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8788509","LTE-U;5G wireless networks;hopfield neural networks;WiFi;proportional fair;resource allocation","Neurons;Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Resource management;Neural networks;Optimization;Quality of service","Hopfield neural nets;Long Term Evolution;optimisation;quality of service;radio access networks;wireless LAN","WiFi networks;unlicensed spectrum;spectrum scarcity;wireless networks;typical LTE transmissions;Base Station;unlicensed bands;contention-based protocols;channel access;WiFi access points;2-Dimensions Hopfield Neural Network;2D-HNN;LTE-U data rate;unlicensed resources;LTE-U users;radio access networks;coexistence mechanism","","15","","19","CCBY","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The prediction is based on a machine-learning approach, where the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is monitored and an upcoming handover is recognized by the pattern of the RSSI over time.

The main reason for the rise of IPS is the futility of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) indoors as the signals are highly attenuated by a number of physical objects. There are several methods, that compensate for the loss of GPS indoors, that achieve indoor positioning, a few of them being Wi-FI, LiFi, Bluetooth and RFID. Apart from using radio frequency and short-range radio frequency waves for indoor positioning, there are other methods to achieve the same using sensors such as inertial measurement unit (IMU), magnetometer, etc. This paper aims to explore the use of Wi-Fi for IPS as it is cost-effective, widely accessible and easy to set up. Among several Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning methods in existence, this paper introduces a novel approach towards improving the accuracy of low-cost Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning systems. This is achieved by selecting specific Wi-Fi channels that are non-overlapping and are subjected to least interference. The obtained received signal strength intensity (RSSI) is analyzed using machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Networks, and the best-suited algorithm is identified. This model can be used for a variety of applications such as asset tracking, industrial resource management, etc. The effectiveness of these applications using IPS depends on the area of the indoor locality together with the accuracy of the machine learning models. The accuracy of the tested model is approximately 4 square metres.","","978-1-7281-1034-9","10.1109/IMICPW.2019.8933285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8933285","","Wireless fidelity;IP networks;Support vector machines;Machine learning algorithms;Prototypes;Bluetooth;Neural networks","Global Positioning System;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);radiofrequency interference;wireless channels;wireless LAN","GPS;Wi-Fi channels;machine learning models;short-range radiofrequency waves;LiFi;Bluetooth;RFID;inertial measurement unit;IMU;magnetometer;RSSI;received signal strength intensity;k-nearest neighbours;support vector machine;artificial neural networks;industrial resource management;Global Positioning Systems;IPS;Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning system;machine learning algorithms","","","","12","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it plays a critical role to identify the experienced attacks for applying further intrusion handling methods. However, existing intrusion detection methods based on traditional machine learning technique usually bears low detection accuracy and need a lot of human intervention. In this backdrop, this paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based intrusion detection algorithm for WiFi networks. Firstly, we present the detection framework, which first conducts data pre-processing, and then a CNN is trained for attack identification.

Specifically, the superframe is divided into two phases: a rendezvous phase and a transmission phase. During the rendezvous phase, the gateway that is capable of machine learning predicts the number of WiFi users and the IoT devices by performing a triangular handshake on the primary channel. The prediction takes advantage of the deep neural network (DNN) model which is pretrained on our universal software radio peripheral (USRP2) testbed offline. The gateway allocates the frequency channels to the WiFi and IoT systems based on the inference results. Then, the IoT devices and WiFi users initiate data transmissions during the transmission phase. Furthermore, system throughput is analyzed and optimized in two typical scenarios, respectively. An optimized MAC framework is proposed to maximize the total system throughput by finding the key design parameters.

As such, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Q-learning based ML techniques are most popular to achieve harmonized coexistence of Wi-Fi with other co-located technologies such as LTE. In the existing coexistence schemes, a co-located technology selects its transmission time based on the level of Wi-Fi traffic generated in its collision domain which is determined by either sniffing the Wi-Fi packets or using a central coordinator that can communicate with the co-located networks to exchange their status and requirements through a collaboration protocol. However, such approaches for sensing traffic status increase cost, complexity, traffic overhead, and reaction time of the coexistence schemes. As a solution to this problem, this work applies a ML-based approach that is capable to determine the saturation status of a Wi-Fi network based on real-time and over-the-air collection of medium occupation statistics about the Wi-Fi frames without the need for decoding. In particular, inter-frame spacing statistics of Wi-Fi frames are used to develop a CNN model that can determine Wi-Fi network saturation. The results demonstrate that the proposed ML-based approach can accurately classify whether a Wi-Fi network is saturated or not.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3066052","European H2020 Programs(grant numbers:952189 (5G-BLUEPRINT project),101016499 (DEDICAT6G project)); CEF Program(grant numbers:INEA/CEF/TRAN/M2016/1364071 (CONCORDA project)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378539","Wi-Fi saturation;traffic load estimation;coexistence;unlicensed spectrum;machine learning;convolutional neural networks","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;5G mobile communication;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless networks;Sensors;Analytical models","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi saturation sensing;Wi-Fi network saturation;Wi-Fi frames;saturation status;ML-based approach;traffic status increase cost;Wi-Fi packets;Wi-Fi traffic;existing coexistence schemes;co-located technology;harmonized coexistence;ML techniques;complex wireless network problems;machine learning techniques;fair coexistence","","3","","53","CCBY","15 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In general, all intelligent vehicle seemed to agree on a combination of non-cumulative error localization method like GPS with more precise localization method but suffered from cumulative errors like Laser-SLAM with an odometer. However, as GPS is only available for outdoor environment and since the indoor environment is also an important scenario for intelligent vehicles, a replacement of GPS for indoor localization is required. Successfully replacing GPS will not only provide a reliable indoor localization method for vehicles but also keep the architecture of vehicle localizing system consistent and achieve a smooth transition from outdoor to indoor and vice versa. Often, movement speed for indoor vehicles will be as low as 10–12km/h [1] but still, it surpasses the movement speed of human walking (3–5km/h) and presents a challenge for a tight and complex environment. This paper proposes an improved WiFi-fingerprinting method to replace GPS behavior for the indoor environment. The key contribution is to use a raw data smoothing technique with an ensemble classification neural network method to deal with noisy WiFi signal strength. Also, environment constraints are applied to improve localization result. Experiments show this method is capable of replacing GPS for the indoor environment.","","978-1-5090-4354-5","10.1109/ICMIM.2017.7918849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7918849","Wifi signal;fingerprinting;neural network;classification;intelligent vehicle;low-speed;indoor localization","Wireless fidelity;Global Positioning System;Intelligent vehicles;Cameras;Fingerprint recognition;Neural networks;Indoor environments","distance measurement;Global Positioning System;indoor environment;indoor navigation;indoor radio;intelligent transportation systems;neural nets;RSSI;wireless LAN","indoor intelligent vehicle localization;WiFi received signal strength indicator;intelligent vehicle navigation;noncumulative error localization method;GPS;precise localization method;laser-SLAM;odometer;vehicle indoor localization method;WiFi-fingerprinting method;data smoothing technique;neural network method;WiFi signal strength","","19","","13","","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, the handover issue in hybrid networks becomes a hotspot since the coverage areas of LiFi and WiFi overlap each other. In addition, LiFi may cause frequent handovers for fast-moving users, while WiFi is susceptible to traffic overload. Consequently, the selection between LiFi and WiFi becomes a tricky problem. In this paper we propose a novel handover scheme, which adopts a dynamic coefficient via machine learning to adjust the selection preference between LiFi and WiFi. The new method balances channel quality, resource availability and user mobility to make handover decisions. Results show that compared to the received signal strength (RSS)-based and trajectory-based handover methods, the proposed scheme can improve the user's throughput by up to 260% and 50%, respectively.","","978-1-7281-7307-8","10.1109/GCWkshps50303.2020.9367577","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9367577","Hybrid network;light fidelity (LiFi);optical wireless communications (OWC);handover;machine learning;artificial neural network","Wireless communication;Neural networks;Machine learning;Handover;Light fidelity;Throughput;Wireless fidelity","cellular radio;free-space optical communication;learning (artificial intelligence);mobility management (mobile radio);telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","hybrid WiFi network;high area spectrum efficiency;light fidelity;ubiquitous coverage;wireless fidelity;handover issue;hybrid networks;coverage areas;frequent handovers;handover decisions;novel machine learning-based handover scheme;hybrid LiFi network","","1","","15","","5 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Typical LTE transmissions are contention-free and centrally controlled by the base station (BS); however, the wireless networks that work in unlicensed bands use contention-based protocols for channel access, which raises the need to derive an efficient and fair coexistence mechanism among different radio access networks. In this work, we propose a novel neural networks (NNs) based mechanism for the coexistence of an LTE-U base station (BS) in the unlicensed spectrum alongside with a WiFi access point (WAP). Specifically, we model the coexistence problem as a Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) based optimization problem that aims a fair coexistence considering both the LTE-U data rate and the QoS requirements of the WiFi network. Using the energy function of HNN, precise investigation of its minimization property can directly provide the solution of the optimization problem.

IoT devices are computer devices that can exchange data and connect wirelessly to a network. IPS is a technology that can be used to locate people or items inside buildings using a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet. Indoor positioning is achieved by using devices already in use such as cellphones, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth antennae, digital cameras, and clocks. RSSI is a metric for assessing the quality of a wireless connection in Wi-Fi devices. But using RSSI values of Wi-Fi may cause inaccuracies in locating any nodes. RSSI is far more prone to interference than a wired network. And these interferences cause the irregularity in Signal strengths. In the case of indoor Wi-Fi positioning, irregular and anomalous RSS data can't be used to pinpoint the location of any unknown node. As a result, this article investigates the RSSI values utilizing machine learning approaches such as supervised, unsupervised, and ensemble learning in an indoor localization scenario employing Wi-Fi devices. The supervised learning techniques utilized in this study include Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. The SOM (Self-Organizing Map) method was utilized in unsupervised learning. Then, this research work has used stacking method that is used for combining different classifiers implemented for ensemble algorithm. Precision, recall, and f1-score are utilized for experiments.

Instead of introducing extra training overhead/set to facilitate the RC-based symbol detection, a new training framework is introduced to take advantage of the signal structure in existing Wi-Fi protocols (e.g., IEEE 802.11 standards), that is, the introduced RC-based symbol detector will utilize the inherent long/short training sequences and structured pilots sent by the Wi-Fi transmitter to conduct online learning of the transmit symbols.

For prediction, a novel hybrid Bayesian neural network model for predicting locations on Cellular Networks (can also be extended to other wireless networks such as Wi-Fi and WiMAX) is suggested. We investigate its different parallel implementation techniques on mobile devices, and compare its performance to many standard neural network techniques such as: Back-propagation, Elman, Resilient, Levenberg-Marqudat, and One-Step Secant models. This approach is free from all unrealistic assumptions about the movement of the users. It is applicable to any arbitrary cell architecture. It attempts to reduce the total location management cost and paging delay. In general, it enhances mobility management in wireless networks (in location management and hand-off management). In our experiments, we compare results of the proposed Bayesian Neural Network with 5 standard neural network techniques in predicting next location. Bayesian learning for Neural Networks predicts location better than standard neural network techniques since it uses well founded probability model to represent uncertainty about the relationship being learned.

Wi-Fi routers are available in almost every building and Wi-Fi chipsets are also available in almost every smartphone. Therefore, fingerprinting of Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values coming from Wi-Fi routers is a cheaper option for indoor localization. In conventional Wi-Fi fingerprinting methods, RSSI values are collected at various indoor locations and stored in a database. The device which needs localization, collects new RSSI values from its current unknown location. These values are compared with the database and the best match is returned as the current user location. Due to differences in Wi-Fi chipsets and environmental conditions, RSSI values fluctuate which makes accurate, stable, fast, and precise determination of user location difficult. If the user is inside a large multi-floor building, dataset scalability and RSSI fluctuations can make the task even more difficult. User tracking and determination of the direction in which the user is moving also becomes challenging due to hurdles and non-walkable points in the indoor environment. To solve these issues, in this paper we present a Wi-Fi fingerprinting method for large indoor environments that uses 1-D convolutional neural networks (CNN) for floor and region-status (hurdle, walkable point) classification. The procedure consists of collecting RSSI dataset which is then normalized and pre-processed. This step is essential for training the classification and localization model. The trained model can be used in real-time for fast, stable, and accurate classification of floors, region-status and user location coordinates. Based on our experiments inside a two floor university library, the proposed approach can classify the floors and region-status with an accuracy of 70.50% and 81.23% respectively, while the mean localization error is 3.47 m.","","978-1-6654-0120-3","10.1109/APWCS50173.2021.9548752","Lahore University of Management Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9548752","Indoor Positioning;Wi-Fi Fingerprinting;Convolution Neural Network (CNN)","Location awareness;Wireless communication;Databases;Buildings;Fingerprint recognition;Indoor environment;Convolutional neural networks","convolutional neural nets;indoor radio;radionavigation;smart phones;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","mean localization error;stable classification;fast classification;region-status;1-D convolutional neural networks;indoor environment;RSSI fluctuations;multifloor building;current user location;current unknown location;indoor locations;RSSI values;conventional Wi-Fi fingerprinting methods;Received Signal Strength Indicator;Wi-Fi chipsets;Wi-Fi routers;location based services;indoor localization;size 3.47 m","","","","14","","30 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, when trying to identify wireless devices that use different specifications of the same Wi-Fi standard, utilizing the frequency domain feature is difficult as the features are too similar between specifications.In this paper, we investigate utilizing a neural network to identify the Wi-Fi standard using raw power measurements. More specifically, we adapt the WaveNet model to take advantage of its capability to handle time series data with thousands of timesteps, an advantage that both recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks do not share. Wi-Fi signals are collected across versions 802.11n, 802.11ac, and 802.11ax both individually and with multiple standards coexisting across a range of different throughputs.

Recently, deep learning has widely been adopted as an efficient solution to this problem. However, in failure cases, predicting a higher-rate MCS can result in a failed transmission. In this case, a retransmission is required, which largely degrades the system throughput. To address this issue, we model the adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) problem as a multi-label multi-class classification problem. The proposed modeling allows more control over what the model predicts in failure cases. We also design a simple, yet powerful, loss function to reduce the number of retransmissions due to higher-rate MCS classification errors. Since wireless channels change significantly due to the surrounding environment, a huge dataset has been generated to cover all possible propagation conditions. However, to reduce training complexity, we train the CNN model using part of the dataset. The effect of different subdataset selection criteria on the classification accuracy is studied.

In this paper, we propose a WiFi CSI based human activity recognition approach using deep recurrent neural network (HARNN). HARNN mainly exploits four key techniques to recognize different human activities. HARNN firstly constructs a novel two-level decision tree for using two environment variation statistics efficiently. Meanwhile, a linear regression method is also introduced to seek for the optimal parameter for the designed decision tree. Depending on this, the decision tree is used to sense indoor environment variation, and then detect whether there is any human activity occurring in a target area. In addition, a noise removal mechanism is devised to eliminate the influence of random noise derived from indoor environments. Then, to characterize various human activities, two representative features are extracted from different statistical profiles, including channel power variation (CPV) and time-frequency analysis (TFA). Finally, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model is utilized to recognize different human activities by leveraging the extracted representative features above. According to the above steps, the proposed HARNN could establish a robust relationship between human activities and WiFi CSI compared with most of the existing WiFi CSI based approaches. The proof-of-concept prototype of HARNN is implemented on a set of commercial WiFi devices, and its overall performance is evaluated in several typical indoor environments. The experimental results demonstrate that HARNN can achieve better recognition performance compared with some benchmark approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2956952","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671346); 111 Project(grant numbers:B08038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8918311","Human activity recognition;commercial WiFi;CSI;CPV;TFA;RNN","Wireless fidelity;Activity recognition;Feature extraction;Indoor environments;Decision trees;Recurrent neural networks","decision trees;feature extraction;indoor radio;random noise;recurrent neural nets;statistical analysis;wireless channels;wireless LAN","time-frequency analysis;TFA;CPV;feature extraction;random noise elimination;noise removal mechanism;linear regression method;smart home;interactive games;WiFi CSI-based human activity recognition approach;two-level decision tree design;recurrent neural network model;channel power variation;indoor environment variation;environment variation statistics;HARNN;channel state information;deep recurrent neural network","","20","","35","CCBY","2 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We are able to detect the human activities like Walk, Stand, Sit, Run, etc. in a Line of Sight scenario (LOS) and a Non Line of Sight (N-LOS) scenario within an indoor environment.

WiFi fingerprinting, which estimates the user's locations using pre-collecting WiFi signals as references, is of particular interest since these days, every user can easily access to WiFi networks. Among numerous methods, deep-neural-network (DNN) based methods have shown an attractive performance but their major drawback is the sensitivity to the fluctuation of received signals (caused by multipaths). To yield a satisfactory performance, thus, a sufficiently large number of possible cases should be trained, which costs a lot. In this paper, we address the above problem by presenting a convolutional neural network (CNN) based localization method. As success in image classifications, the proposed method can be robust to the small changes of received signals as it exploits the topology of a radio map as well as signal strengths.

Many of the schemes are learning-based, among which CSI fingerprinting based on deep learning is the most promising. Learning-based schemes assume the distributions of CSI fingerprints keep relatively stable over time. However, this assumption often does not hold. As WiFi signals are prone to be influenced by various environmental factors, CSI fingerprints vary significantly with environmental changes. Consequently, the localization model built for the original environment degrades dramatically in the changed environment. Recalibrating the whole area of interest is labor-intensive and time-consuming. This is a major challenge of device-free WiFi localization. To mitigate this issue, we propose the method AdapLoc, aiming to adapt the original localization model to the changed environment with significantly reduced recalibration effort. AdapLoc is based on one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and exploits Domain Adaptation (DA) with Semantic Alignment (SA) to achieve adaptation. Extensive evaluations in four real-world single-link testbeds with multiple environmental changes demonstrate the effectiveness of AdapLoc in coping with localization in dynamic environments, outperforming the existing work with respect to localization and adaptation.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2020.3014641","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9161004","Channel state information (CSI);convolutional neural network (CNN);device-free localization (DFL);domain adaptation (DA);semantic alignment (SA)","Adaptation models;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Neural networks;Adaptive systems;Semantics","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);semantic networks;wireless channels;wireless LAN","CSI fingerprints;WiFi signals;environmental factors;device-free WiFi localization;original localization model;reduced recalibration effort;one-dimensional convolutional neural network;domain adaptation;adaptive device-free localization;adaptive neural networks;WiFi channel state information;deep learning-based schemes;AdapLoc method;semantic alignment;SA;1D-CNN;DA","","7","","39","IEEE","6 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This work focuses on the prediction of duty cycle (DC) metric that reflects spectrum usage (in the time domain). The spectrum usage is typically measured on a shorter time scale than needed for prediction. Hence, data thinning is required and we apply block averaging. However, averaging operation results in flattening the DC data and losing essential features to assist deep neural network (DNN) to predict the spectrum usage. To improve DC prediction after block averaging, a feature-based deep learning framework is proposed. Namely, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) are selected and enhanced by using features of the data, such as the variance of DC data in addition to DC data themself. The proposed model is capable of proactively predicting the spectrum usage by capturing complex relationships among various input features for the measured spectrum, thus providing higher prediction accuracy with an average improvement of 5% in RMSE compared with traditional models. Moreover, to have a better understanding of the proposed model, we quantify the effect of input features on the predicted spectrum usage values.

Also, with the increased automation of our daily routines by our mobile devices via a multitude of applications, our vulnerability to cyber fraud or attacks becomes higher too. Hence, the need for heightened security that is capable of detecting anomalies on-the-fly. However, these edge devices connected to the local area network come with diverse capabilities with varying degrees of limitations in compute and energy resources. Therefore, running a process-based anomaly detector is not given a high priority in these devices because; a) the primary functions of the applications running on the devices is not security; therefore, the device allocates much of its resources into satisfying the primary duty of the applications. b) the volume and velocity of the data are high.

We test the framework in a Wi-Fi-based ad-hoc network made up of several devices, and the results confirm our hypothesis that the scheme can reduce latency and increase the throughput of the anomaly detector, thereby making online anomaly detection in the edge possible without sacrificing the accuracy of the deep recurrent neural network.","","978-1-7281-4550-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2019.00169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8999167","Anomaly Detection, Machine Learning, Distributed System, Parallelism, Edge Devices","Anomaly detection;Kernel;Security;Ad hoc networks;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Machine learning","ad hoc networks;computer crime;computer network security;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile handsets;recurrent neural nets;resource allocation;wireless LAN","distributed anomaly detection;edge computing;mobile technologies;cell phones;smart watches;Wi-Fi hotspots;mobile devices;anomalies on-the-fly;edge devices;local area network;process-based anomaly detector;offloading scheme;online anomaly detection;deep recurrent neural network;Wi-Fi-based ad-hoc network;Internet on-the-go;cyber fraud;cyber attacks","","","","21","","17 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing methods such as decision tree (DT) and Naïve Bayes (NB) techniques have some drawbacks. DT has low efficiency because it uses the Boolean function, and NB provides a low accuracy of prediction for the sparse dataset. In this research, fingerprint referencing with two important methods, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) machine learning algorithms, are used to enable accurate indoor localization. Furthermore, data normalization is implemented to reduce positioning error by increasing the inconsistency of the RSS values. Further, several experiments have been conducted by using three mobile devices in the area of 280 m<sup>2</sup>to create our dataset by taking 480 RSS records for both training and testing phases. The results show that the accuracy LSTM algorithm is 0.9 m, whereas the SVM algorithm accuracy is 1.1 m.

Firstly, CSI measurements are collected by a commercial WiFi device, and then a buffer and filtering mechanism-based gait detection algorithm is proposed to solve the effects of short-term anomalous fluctuation. After that, a recurrent neural network, LSTM, is used to identify different people by discriminating the temporal characteristics of automatically extracted human gait features. We evaluated the proposed HumanFi using a dataset with 1920 gait instances collected from 24 human subjects walking in two different scenes.

In the last few years, researchers have begun to study the use of Deep Neural Network (DNN) to identify different types of modulation, and by using it the task has become easier, and we can get a significant improvement in the classification performance compared to many traditional methods. In this paper an automatic modulation Classification model is proposed where deep learning is used to classify different types of modulation at different signal to noise ratios (SNRs), where we optimize the conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture of O’Shea (2016) [1] by selecting the values of the CNN hyperparameters that result in obtaining the best accuracy for each SNR.

In the present paper, we propose a Wi-Fi fingerprinting indoor positioning system which utilizes the single multiplicative neuron (SMN) as a fingerprinting technique to improve the positioning accuracy and speed. Neural networks based on single multiplicative neuron are simple in their structure and fast in the learning process, which make them suitable for real-time applications. We use the principal component analysis algorithm (PCA) in both the offline and the online phases to reduce the dimension of the received signal strength values and to remove the noisy measurements. Comparisons have been held with three well-known fingerprinting techniques: KNN, SVM and NN.

ML has been successfully applied to several practical tasks like image recognition, automating industrial operations, etc. The promise of ML techniques in solving non-linear problems influenced this work which aims to apply known ML techniques and develop new ones for wireless spectrum sharing between Wi-Fi and LTE in the unlicensed spectrum. In this work, we focus on the LTE-Unlicensed (LTE-U) specification developed by the LTE-U Forum, which uses the duty-cycle approach for fair coexistence. The specification suggests reducing the duty cycle at the LTE-U base-station (BS) when the number of co-channel Wi-Fi basic service sets (BSSs) increases from one to two or more. However, without decoding the Wi-Fi packets, detecting the number of Wi-Fi BSSs operating on the channel in real-time is a challenging problem. In this work, we demonstrate a novel ML-based approach which solves this problem by using energy values observed during the LTE-U OFF duration. It is relatively straightforward to observe only the energy values during the LTE-U BS OFF time compared to decoding the entire Wi-Fi packet, which would require a full Wi-Fi receiver at the LTE-U base-station. We implement and validate the proposed ML-based approach by real-time experiments and demonstrate that there exist distinct patterns between the energy distributions between one and many Wi-Fi AP transmissions. The proposed ML-based approach results in a higher accuracy (close to 99% in all cases) as compared to the existing auto-correlation (AC) and energy detection (ED) approaches.","2644-1330","","10.1109/OJVT.2020.2981519","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS - 1618920); Center For Unstoppable Computing; University of Chicago; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9040538","LTE;Unlicensed Spectrum;Wi-Fi;Machine Learning","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Machine learning;Decoding;Wireless networks;Energy states;Industries","cochannel interference;decoding;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;radio spectrum management;wireless LAN","wireless spectrum;nonlinear problems;ML techniques;industrial operations;attractive solution;complex engineering problems;spectrum sharing;ML-based approach results;Wi-Fi AP transmissions;Wi-Fi receiver;entire Wi-Fi packet;LTE-U OFF duration;energy values;novel ML-based approach;Wi-Fi BSSs operating;Wi-Fi packets;cochannel Wi-Fi basic service sets;base-station;duty cycle;fair coexistence;duty-cycle approach;LTE-U Forum;LTE-Unlicensed;unlicensed spectrum","","8","","44","CCBY","18 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A dynamic Que-Fi model is proposed to identify the entering/leaving people's behavior and update the counting number. In this article, different preprocessing methods are analyzed and compared to test and evaluate the proposed Que-Fi.

Indoor positioning method based on inertial navigation real-time location of pedestrian path and wireless signal fingerprint with the online positioning by using the neural network matching algorithm outperforms the KNN algorithm in the positioning accuracy, so it can avoid the cumulative error of inertial navigation and positioning, and also reduce the influence of environment interference factor on the positioning accuracy, finally verified by experiments two, positioning algorithm combined with neural network positioning result is obviously better than the traditional positioning accuracy.","","978-1-5386-4201-6","10.1109/ICITBS.2018.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8332744","WIFI signal;fingerprint;inertial navigation;neural network;accuracy","Conferences;Transportation;Big Data;Smart cities","indoor navigation;inertial navigation;mobile handsets;neural nets;radionavigation;RSSI;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi signal fingerprint positioning;environment interference factor;neural network matching algorithm;online positioning;wireless signal fingerprint;inertial navigation real-time location;indoor positioning method;intelligent mobile phone;cumulative error;inertial positioning;complex indoor environment;wireless signal strength;noise signals;indoor localization algorithm","","5","","8","","9 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many Wi-Fi network systems commonly employee machine learning based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Such IDS usually adopt supervised methods that heavily depend on observations of human experts for feature extraction, feature selection, and labeling processes of training data for classification. In this study, using the recently collected Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) which contains real traces of different network attacks types, we propose an unsupervised approach with automatic feature extraction and selection process to replace human intervention and manual labeling process for analyzing a large scale high dimensional data to improve the prediction accuracy of classification to detect 3 most common network attack types - Injection, Flooding, and Impersonate attacks in an IDS with a large scale of high dimensional data.

The result is an unchecked environment for exploiters and attackers to distribute content such as fake, radical and propaganda videos. Recent advances in machine learning techniques have shown great promise in characterising encrypted traffic captured at the end points. However, video fingerprinting from passively listening to encrypted traffic, especially wireless traffic, has been reported as a challenging task due to the difficulty in distinguishing retransmissions and multiple flows on the same link. We show the potential of fingerprinting videos by passively sniffing WiFi frames in air, even without connecting to the WiFi network. We have developed Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that are able to identify streamed YouTube videos from a closed set, by sniffing WiFi traffic encrypted at both Media Access Control (MAC) and Network layers.

Its usages have proliferated beyond the military sector to various commercial and consumer activities such as package delivery, disaster relief, agriculture and filming. With the rise of Wi-Fi controlled drone. Wi-Fi controlled drone has increased its popularity for personal use due to its affordability, and the ease of operating the drone through smart-devices like mobile phone, tablets and computers. As such, this increases the likelihood of drone presence in various environments, especially in critical government infrastructure, leading to various privacy and security concern by the authorities and the public with malicious intent. Therefore, various signature-based methodology of drone detection has emerged such as the visual and Radio Frequency (RF) signature-based detection method. Visual signature-based detection relies on camera capture and image processing but this is an expensive approach. Whereas, RF signature- based detection relies on the identification of the emission of RF signal by the drone. However, since most commercial electronics devices were built based on Wi-Fi technology, the differentiation of the RF signals transmitted between a drone or a standard Wi-Fi device in a crowded Wi-Fi environment such as a school campus or city area is an challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning approach that leverages on the identified unique signatures of Wi-Fi devices in terms of Radio Frequency (RF) and network packets measurement to differentiate the presence of Wi-Fi drone and standard Wi-Fi devices in an urban setting. Furthermore, we also carried out a meticulous pre-processing procedure and a better training scheme of using Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation (SKFCV), to enhance the richness in the data signature and fully exploit the permutation of the data during training respectively for better performance of the ML models. Two supervised classification Machine Learning (ML) models, namely the Logistic Regression (LR), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied using the joint data measurements to identify the presence of drone in dense Wi-Fi environment. The experimental results have shown that the proposed novel ML approach of using both RF and network measurement signatures coupled with the pre-processing and training methodology on LR and ANN ML models have outperformed the traditional RF signature-based drone detection ML accuracy results by 15.1% and 21.63% respectively in a crowded Wi-Fi environment.","1559-9450","978-1-7281-3403-1","10.1109/PIERS-Spring46901.2019.9017231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9017231","","Drones;Wireless fidelity;Radio frequency;Springs;Standards;Training;Software","aerospace computing;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;regression analysis;remotely operated vehicles;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","stratified k-fold cross-validation;artificial neural network;logistic regression;wireless controlled drone detection;network signature-based machine learning;Wi-Fi technology;commercial electronics devices;RF signal;visual signature-based detection;signature-based methodology;Wi-Fi controlled drone;drone usage;traditional RF signature-based drone detection ML accuracy results;network measurement signatures;dense Wi-Fi environment;data signature;Wi-Fi drone;network packets measurement;Wi-Fi devices;crowded Wi-Fi environment;standard Wi-Fi device","","3","","14","","2 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In such a technology driven society there is always a need to create a system which can be used to monitor the usage of water in different apartments of a building. The main problem here is that there is no way to know how much of water is used in different apartments of a building and the cost of installation of separate water meters is too high also it will need a lot of construction work to install it. Currently there is no system to which is efficient enough to complete this such type of task as it need human efforts at many stages. In this there is a need of creation a system which can be installed easily with very less or no construction also it should be able to collect data and then it should continuously stream whole data to server for processing and generate result in real time also, the overall cost should be low enough that it can be used commercially. In this paper we are focusing on creating a low-cost smart device which can be used to collect the data of water consumption. To achieve this, we have proposed to create a device with Arduino along with some sensors and modules to collect multiple data of water consumption from different apartments. After collecting this data this device will send this data to server with the help of a Wi-Fi module attached to the device. At the same time, we are using an Artificial Neural Network model for the analysis of this data for generating high accuracy results.

However, the deployment of LTE in such bands implies sharing spectrum with mature technologies such as Wi-Fi. Several studies have discussed this coexistence problem by suggesting that LTE implements different adaptation mechanisms that allow transmission possibilities to Wi-Fi. While such adaptation mechanisms exist, they still negatively impact Wi-Fi performance, mainly due to the lack of collaboration/coordination mechanisms that inform about the co-located networks' activities. In this paper, we propose a distributed spectrum management framework that enhances the performance of Wi-Fi, as a particular case, by detecting harmful co-located wireless networks and changes the Wi-Fi's operating central frequency to avoid them. The framework is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can identify different wireless technologies and provides spectrum usage statistics. Experiments were carried out in a real-life testbed, and the results show that Wi-Fi maintains its performance when using our framework.

An individual's limb motions in the WiFi coverage area could interfere with wireless signal propagation, that manifested as unique patterns for activity recognition. Existing approaches though yielding reasonable performance in certain cases, are ignorant of two major challenges. The performed activities of the individual normally have inconsistent speed in different situations and time. Besides that the wireless signal reflected by human bodies normally carries substantial information that is specific to that subject. The activity recognition model trained on a certain individual may not work well when being applied to predict another individual's activities. Since only recording activities of limited subjects in a certain speed and scale, recent works commonly have a moderate amount of activity data for training the recognition model. The small-size data could often incur the overfitting issue that negative affect the traditional classification model. To address these challenges, we propose a WiFi-based human activity recognition system that synthesizes variant activities data through eight channel state information (CSI) transformation methods to mitigate the impact of activity inconsistency and subject-specific issues, and also design a novel deep-learning model that caters to the small-size WiFi activity data.

Such uncertainty arises naturally in wireless networks, since an efficient user tracking is based on a prediction of its future call and mobility parameters. The conventional approach based on dynamic tracking is not reliable in the sense that inaccurate prediction of the user mobility parameters may significantly reduce the tracking efficiency. Unfortunately, such uncertainty is unavoidable for mobile users, especially for a burst mobility patterns. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid Bayesian neural network model for predicting locations on Cellular Networks (can also be extended to other wireless networks such as WI-FI and WiMAX). We investigate different parallel implementation techniques on mobile devices of the proposed approach and compare it to many standard neural network techniques such as: Back-propagation, Elman, Resilient, Levenberg-Marqudat, and One-Step Secant models. Bayesian learning for Neural Networks predicts location better than standard neural network techniques since it uses well founded probability model to represent uncertainty about the relationships being learned. The result of Bayesian training is a posterior distribution over network weights.

Therefore, CSI has become one of the most commonly used features in indoor Wi-Fi localization. In addition, compared to the CSI geometric localization method, the CSI fingerprint localization method has the advantages of easy implementation and high accuracy. However, as the scale of the fingerprint database increases, the training cost and processing complexity of CSI fingerprints will also greatly increase. Based on this, this article proposes to combine backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) with CSI tensor decomposition for indoor Wi-Fi fingerprint localization. Specifically, the tensor decomposition algorithm based on the parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis model and the alternate least squares (ALSs) iterative algorithm are combined to reduce the interference of the environment. Then, we use the tensor wavelet decomposition algorithm for feature extraction and obtain the CSI fingerprint. Finally, in order to find the optimal weights and thresholds and then obtain the estimated location coordinates, we introduce an AGA to optimize BPNN.

The emergence of big shopping malls, indoor sports complexes, factories, and warehouses is accelerating this tendency. In such an environment, indoor localization becomes one of the essential services, and the indoor localization systems to be deployed should be scalable enough to cover the expected expansion of those indoor facilities. One of the most economical and practical approaches to indoor localization is Wi-Fi fingerprinting, which exploits the widely-deployed Wi-Fi networks using mobile devices (e.g., smart-phones) without any modification of the existing infrastructure. Traditional Wi-Fi fingerprinting schemes rely on complicated data pre/post-processing and time-consuming manual parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose hierarchical multi-building and multi-floor indoor localization based on a recurrent neural network (RNN) using Wi-Fi fingerprinting, eliminating the need of complicated data pre/post-processing and with less parameter tuning. The RNN in the proposed scheme estimates locations in a sequential manner from a general to a specific one (e.g., building→floor→location) in order to exploit the hierarchical nature of the localization in multi-building and multi-floor environments. The experimental results with the UJIIndoorLoc dataset demonstrate that the proposed scheme estimates building and floor with 100% and 95.24% accuracy, respectively, and provides three-dimensional positioning error of 8.62 m, which outperforms existing deep neural network-based schemes.","","978-1-6654-2835-4","10.1109/CANDARW53999.2021.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9644181","Multi-building and multi-floor Indoor localization;Wi-Fi fingerprinting;recurrent neural networks (RNNs)","Location awareness;Recurrent neural networks;Three-dimensional displays;Buildings;Urban areas;Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity","","","","","","19","","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Towards this direction, the long-term evolution (LTE) operation in the unlicensed spectrum has been proposed. Targeting a global solution that respects the regional requirements, 3GPP announced the standard of LTE licensed assisted access (LAA). However, LTE LAA may result in unfair coexistence with Wi-Fi, especially when Wi-Fi does not use frame aggregation. Targeting a technique that enables fair channel access, the mLTE-U scheme has been proposed. According to mLTE-U, LTE uses a variable transmission opportunity, followed by a variable muting period that can be exploited by other networks to transmit. For the selection of the appropriate mLTE-U configuration, information about the dynamically changing wireless environment is required. To this end, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to perform identification of LTE and Wi-Fi transmissions. In addition, it can identify the hidden terminal effect caused by multiple LTE transmissions, multiple Wi-Fi transmissions, or concurrent LTE and Wi-Fi transmissions. The designed CNN has been trained and validated using commercial off-the-shelf LTE and Wi-Fi hardware equipment and for two wireless signal representations, namely, in-phase and quadrature samples and frequency domain representation through fast Fourier transform. The classification accuracy of the two resulting CNNs is tested for different signal to noise ratio values. The experimentation results show that the data representation affects the accuracy of CNN. The obtained information from CNN can be exploited by the mLTE-U scheme in order to provide fair coexistence between the two wireless technologies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902035","H2020 LEIT Information and Communication Technologies(grant numbers:732174 (ORCA Project)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8661488","Convolutional neural network;LTE;Wi-Fi;coexistence;spectral efficiency;unlicensed spectrum","Long Term Evolution;Wireless fidelity;Wireless communication;Hardware;Signal to noise ratio;Wireless sensor networks","3G mobile communication;convolutional neural nets;fast Fourier transforms;Long Term Evolution;multi-access systems;signal representation;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","wireless environment;convolutional neural network;CNN;Wi-Fi hardware equipment;wireless signal representations;mLTE-U scheme;unlicensed spectrum;wireless traffic;wireless spectrum;long-term evolution operation;LTE LAA;fair channel access;LTE transmissions;Wi-Fi transmissions;LTE licensed assisted access;frequency domain representation;fast Fourier transform;data representation;3GPP","","25","","46","OAPA","6 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite its huge potential in spurring economic growth by supporting various applications, the increase of consumer UAVs poses potential risks to public security and personal privacy. To minimize the risks, efficiently detecting and identifying invading UAVs is in urgent need for both invasion detection and forensics purposes. Aiming to complement the existing physical detection mechanisms, we propose a machine learning-based framework for fast UAV identification over encrypted Wi-Fi traffic. It is motivated by the observation that many consumer UAVs use Wi-Fi links for control and video streaming. The proposed framework extracts features derived only from packet size and inter-arrival time of encrypted Wi-Fi traffic, and can efficiently detect UAVs and identify their operation modes. In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts a re-weighted ℓ<sub>1</sub>-norm regularization, which considers the number of samples and computation cost of different features. This framework jointly optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective function. To tackle the packet inter-arrival time uncertainty when optimizing the trade-off between the detection accuracy and delay, we utilize maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to estimate the packet inter-arrival time. We collect a large number of real-world Wi-Fi data traffic of eight types of consumer UAVs and conduct extensive evaluation on the performance of our proposed method. Evaluation results show that our proposed method can detect and identify tested UAVs within 0.15-0.35s with high accuracy of 85.7-95.2%. The UAV detection range is within the physical sensing range of 70m and 40m in the line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, respectively.

Most conventional work under the machine-learning framework utilizes handcrafted features (e.g., statistic features) that are unable to sufficiently describe the sequence data and heavily rely on designers' experiences. Therefore, how to automatically learn abundant spatial-temporal information from CSI data is a topic worthy of study. In this article, we propose a deep learning framework that integrates spatial features learned from the convolutional neural network (CNN) into the temporal model multilayer bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Specifically, CSI streams are segmented into a series of patches, from which spatial features are extracted by our designed CNN structure. Considering long-term dependencies between adjacent sequences, the fully connected layer of CNN for each patch is taken as the Bi-LSTM sequential input to further capture temporal features. Our model is appealing in that it can simultaneously learn temporal dynamics and convolutional perceptual representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore deep spatial-temporal features for CSI-based action recognition. Furthermore, in order to solve the problem that the trained model fully fails with environmental changes, we use the off-the-shelf model as the pretrained model and fine-tune it in the new scenario. The transfer method is able to realize cross-scene action recognition with low computational consumption and satisfactory accuracy.

Therefore, in this work, we study the application of end-to-end sequence models for finer-level WiFi-based indoor localization.

The regression output is used to estimate three-dimensional positions and allows the network to easily scale to larger areas.

In the area covered with WiFi, human movements may cause observable variations of WiFi signals. By analyzing the CSI fingerprint patterns and modeling the dependency between CSI fingerprints and locations through DNN, the proposed method is able to localize the targets according to the measured CSI fingerprints through DNN regression. Localization with DNN is accurate for static targets, yet unable to form reasonable trajectories of moving targets. This paper proposes to apply PF on DNN localization results and form the walking trajectories of the targets. To avoid the trajectories to cross obstacles, map matching is integrated to constrain the unreasonable transfer of particles, which further improves the precision of trajectories. To combat with environmental variants, fine tuning on DNN is proposed to enhance the adaptivity of the method. Extensive evaluations in two representative scenarios with only one pair of WiFi transmitter and receiver achieve the high accuracy of around half a meter and precise trajectories as well as adaptation to environmental variants.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2019.2921554","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8744478","Channel state information;deep neural network;device-free tracking;fine tuning;map matching;particle filtering","Target tracking;Wireless fidelity;Trajectory;Feature extraction;Tuning;Radar tracking;Neural networks","neural nets;particle filtering (numerical methods);radio receivers;radio transmitters;wireless channels;wireless LAN","DNN regression;walking trajectories;WiFi receiver;deep neural networks;electronic devices;WiFi channel state information;WiFi signals;CSI fingerprint measurement patterns;device-free human tracking method;DNN localization;FreeTrack;particle filtering;PF;WiFi transmitter","","8","","24","IEEE","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recognition application utilizes the Channel State Information (CSI) of the Wi-Fi signal and captures the human gestures as signal amplitude and phase values. Most existing gesture recognition studies utilize only the amplitude values ignoring the phase information. Few works use both amplitude and phase information for recognition application. Besides, the existing studies adopt deep learning networks, especially Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to improve recognition performance better. This motivates the present work to study the influence of using (i) amplitude values and (ii) amplitude and phase values together, using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, as an alternate for CNN. Moreover, the proposed LSTM framework is fed with the CSI values without much pre-processing applied on it, except standardizing the data to make it more suitable for classification. This paper applies the proposed LSTM framework on a public sign language gesture dataset, SignFi with Adam and SGDM optimizer and analyses the performance with increasing hidden units.

While maximal utilization is desirable for unlicensed LTE, it is essentially important not to disturb WiFi activity in the unlicensed channel when designing a coexistence scheme. Opportunistic exploitation of idle gaps, or white spaces, in the WiFi channel for unlicensed LTE transmissions enables achieving the above objectives. However, complex analytical approaches to the opportunistic coexistence problem require considerable computation and might result in excessive latency, which would be undesirable. Machine learning schemes may reduce the computational complexity and hence not only reduce the latency but also help with energy consumption in wireless communications systems.We propose a novel algorithm based on reinforcement learning technique for the problem of opportunistic coexistence of unlicensed LTE and WiFi. The proposed approach in particular is based on Q-Learning, which provides a robust and model-free decision-making framework that enables online and distributive coexistence of small cells with WiFi.

In this paper, we measure and assess patterns associated with dynamic human activities, such as the actions of sitting-down and standing-up, by analyzing Wi-Fi channel state information. Two Wi-Fi sensors are used to capture information about a person's activities within a limited space. The effect of sensor location and activity location within the space are assessed to study the independence of the proposed solution with respect to these factors. From the acquired data, feature vectors of 168 variables of kurtosis, maximum, maximum peak, mean, minimum, skew, standard deviation, and variance values are calculated. Traditional classifiers are evaluated for the prediction of dynamic sitting and standing activities. Results obtained demonstrate a classification accuracy of 98.5% using a medium Gaussian support vector machine. Deep learning using a bidirectional long short-term memory network is also tested for sequence-to-label and sequence-to-sequence classification from time series of statistical measures. These models achieved accuracies of 90.7% and 85.1%, respectively. The proposed feature extraction and applied classification demonstrate the ability of our solution to not only differentiate between static and motion activities, but also distinguish between the similar motions of standing-up and sitting-down. Therefore, this work goes beyond the state-of-the-art that generally focuses on detecting motion, not distinguishing between similar movements by subjects.","","978-1-6654-1914-7","10.1109/MeMeA52024.2021.9478778","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9478778","Wi-Fi;channel state information;activities of daily living;human activity recognition;smart spaces;deep learning","Support vector machines;Time series analysis;Sociology;Feature extraction;Time measurement;Real-time systems;Sensors","deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;Gaussian processes;home networks;learning (artificial intelligence);motion sensors;recurrent neural nets;sensor placement;support vector machines;time series;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","feature extraction;bidirectional long short-term memory network;mean values;variance values;maximum peak calculation;kurtosis calculation;feature vector;human activities recognition;standing-up action;sitting-down action;residential well-being assessments;deep learning;medium Gaussian support vector machine;standard deviation;activity location;sensor location;Wi-Fi sensors;Wi-Fi channel state information;machine learning classification;location independence","","","","22","","12 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, in order to effectively use the unlicensed spectrum, several challenges have to be addressed. The most important of which is how to coexist with the incumbent unlicensed WiFi networks. Incorporating the ""intelligence"" component into the network radios is foreseen to resolve the intrinsic network challenges, rather than conventional non-adaptive action plans. Specifically, an intelligent cognitive engine (CE) that continuously monitors the environment, and dynamically decides upon the best mechanisms and their configuration to suit a given scenario, is essential. In this work, we propose a machine learning-based monitoring module that provides real-time situational awareness that is envisaged to provide the necessary adaptivity, intelligence, autonomy, and learning capabilities. The objective of the proposed intelligent monitoring module is to sense, assess and select the most appropriate scheduling and resource allocation (SRA) algorithm at each LTE base station, according to the different coexistence scenarios. We propose a random forest classifier that maximizes the overall LTE throughput without degrading that of the WiFi network. Numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the monitoring module in achieving robust adaptive results under new unfamiliar network environments. Furthermore, we shed some lights on the comparison between the performance of multiple SRA algorithms under dynamic network settings.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473865","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473865","Coexistence;network monitoring;LTE unlicensed (LTE-U);licensed-assisted access (LAA);CSAT;LBT;NS-3;machine learning;random forest","Machine learning algorithms;Conferences;Heuristic algorithms;Numerical simulation;Real-time systems;Classification algorithms;Monitoring","learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;random forests;resource allocation;telecommunication scheduling;wireless LAN","incumbent unlicensed WiFi networks;intelligence component;network radios;intrinsic network challenges;nonadaptive action;intelligent cognitive engine;machine learning-based monitoring module;real-time situational awareness;learning capabilities;intelligent monitoring module;scheduling;base station;coexistence scenarios;LTE throughput;unfamiliar network environments;dynamic network settings;Long-Term Evolution;unlicensed band;spectrum scarcity problem;unlicensed spectrum;random forest classifier","","","","23","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Commercial, industrial and residential buildings often incorporate systems used to determine occupancy. However, relatively simple sensor technology and control algorithms limit the effectiveness of smart building services. In this paper we propose to replace sensor technology with time series models that can predict the number of occupants at a given location and time. We use Wi-Fi datasets readily available in abundance for smart building services and train Auto Regression Integrating Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) time series models. As a use case scenario of smart building services, these models allow forecasting of the number of people at a given time and location in 15, 30 and 60 minutes time intervals at building as well as Access Point (AP) level. For LSTM, we build our models in two ways: a separate model for every time scale, and a combined model for the three time scales. Our experiments show that LSTM combined model reduced the computational resources with respect to the number of neurons by 74.48 % for the AP level, and by 67.13 % for the building level. Further, the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced by 88.2%-93.4% for LSTM in comparison to ARIMA for the building levels models and by 80.9 %-87% for the AP level models.","","978-1-5386-2588-0","10.1109/HPCC-SmartCity-DSS.2017.7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8291910","Time series;Machine Learning;ARIMA;LSTM;Smart Buildings;Smart Homes;IoT services;Wi-Fi networks","Time series analysis;Autoregressive processes;Computational modeling;Smart buildings;Wireless fidelity;Predictive models","autoregressive moving average processes;building management systems;buildings (structures);image sensors;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;neural nets;regression analysis;time series;wireless LAN","deep LSTM neural networks;Wi-Fi networks;smart buildings;smart building services;commercial buildings;industrial buildings;residential buildings;train Auto Regression Integrating Moving Average models;Long Short-Term Memory time series models;time scale;building levels models;time intervals;time 30.0 min;time 60.0 min;time 15 min","","16","","24","","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We study unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques to conclude that a multilayer perceptron is the best model to detect the causes of active scanning. Further, we perform an in-vivo model validation in an uncontrolled real-world WiFi network. We also compare our models with a static rule-based approach. Our model improves the mean F1-score accuracy of cause detection from 0.78 to 0.99. Our proposed mechanism has the potential of being incorporated in the existing WiFi controllers, such as that of Cisco and Aruba.","","978-1-7281-0270-2","10.1109/WoWMoM.2019.8793010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8793010","","Wireless fidelity;Probes;Machine learning;Performance evaluation;Multilayer perceptrons;Training","multilayer perceptrons;supervised learning;telecommunication computing;unsupervised learning;wireless LAN","supervised machine learning technique;unsupervised machine learning technique;multilayer perceptron;static rule-based approach;Cisco;Aruba;large-scale WiFi network;network troubleshooting;unnecessary active scanning;cause detection;in-vivo model validation","","4","","24","","12 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present a novel alternative that uses Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) processed through a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. The amplitude and phase of 51 Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing sub carriers in the IEEE802.11n standard are captured with two ESP32 devices. Of the candidate DNNs trained with the CSI data, a ID-Convolutional Neural Network is experimentally demonstrated to count up to 12 pedestrians with an accuracy of 79 % at the current level of training. This can be generalized to perform robustly across different environments, and having a footprint of 1.2MB, can be implemented on a Raspberry Pi 4 device. Our contributions include the use of 51 subcarriers, successful outdoor performance, and implementation on low-cost COTS components.

Quality monitoring tests for engineering and optimization by Wi-Fi hotspot providers mostly focus on some throughput measurements to remote servers. In case of QoS degradation it is unclear, whether the local Wi-Fi access network has become the bottleneck for these measurements.

We first employ an auto-encoder to extract representative latent codes of fingerprints. Such an extraction is proven to be more reliable than simply using a deep neural network to extract representative features since a latent code can be reverted back to its original input. Then, a sequence of latent codes are injected into an LSTM network to identify location.

Traditional schemes based on commodity WiFi devices can achieve real-time LOS/NLOS identification. However, these methods face the challenges of limited bandwidth and coarse multipath resolution. In this work, we explore the amplitude feature of PHY layer information, and accordingly propose AmpN, a real-time LOS identification scheme based on commodity WiFi infrastructure that is applicable in both static and mobile scenarios. AmpN employs BP neural network algorithm in static scenario and K-Mean method in dynamic scenario, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that AmpN outperforms existing approaches, achieving overall LOS and NLOS detection rates of 94.2% and 97.6% in static case, and above 97% LOS and NLOS detection rates in mobile context.

In this paper, we propose CNNLoc, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based indoor localization system with WiFi fingerprints for multi-building and multifloor localization. Specifically, we devise a novel classification model by combining a Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) with a onedimensional CNN. The SAE is utilized to precisely extract key features from sparse Received Signal Strength (RSS) data while the CNN is trained to effectively achieve high success rates in the positioning phase.

First, we present a novel shallow neural network (SNN) in which features are extracted from the channel state information (CSI) corresponding to WiFi subcarriers received on different antennas and used to train the model. The single-layer architecture of this localisation neural network makes it lightweight and easy-to-deploy on devices with stringent constraints on computational resources. We further investigate for localisation the use of deep learning models and design novel architectures for convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM). We extensively evaluate these localisation algorithms for continuous tracking in indoor environments. Experimental results prove that even an SNN model, after a careful handcrafted feature extraction, can achieve accurate localisation. Meanwhile, using a well-organised architecture, the neural network models can be trained directly with raw data from the CSI and localisation features can be automatically extracted to achieve accurate position estimates. We also found that the performance of neural network-based methods are directly affected by the number of anchor access points (APs) regardless of their structure. With three APs, all neural network models proposed in this paper can obtain localisation accuracy of around 0.5 metres. In addition the proposed deep NN architecture reduces the data pre-processing time by 6.5 hours compared with a shallow NN using the data collected in our testbed. In the deployment phase, the inference time is also significantly reduced to 0.1 ms per sample.

Given a training radio map (TRM), i.e., a set of coordinate vectors and associated WLAN/WiFi signal strengths of the available access points, a BPNN can be trained to output the expected signal strengths for any input position within the region of interest (BPNN-RM). This can be used to provide a continuous representation of the radio map and to filter, densify or decimate a discrete radio map. Correspondingly, the TRM can also be used to train another BPNN to output the expected position within the region of interest for any input vector of recorded signal strengths and thus carry out localization (BPNN-LA). Key aspects of the design of such artificial neural networks for a specific application are the selection of design parameters like the number of hidden layers and nodes within the network, and the training procedure. Summarizing extensive numerical simulations, based on real measurements in a testbed, we analyze the impact of these design choices on the performance of the BPNN and compare the results in particular to those obtained using the κ nearest neighbors (κNN) and weighted κ nearest neighbors approaches to FWIPS. The results indicate that BPNN-RM can help to reduce the workload for radio map generation significantly by allowing to sample the signal strengths at significantly less positions during the offline phase while still obtaining equal or even slightly better accuracy during the online stage as when directly applying the sampled radio map to (weighted) κNN. In the scenario analyzed within the paper the workload can be reduced by almost 90%. We also show that a BPNN-LA with only 1 hidden layer outperforms networks with more hidden layers and yields positioning accuracy comparable to or even slightly better than κNN but with less computational burden during the online stage.","","978-1-5090-2879-5","10.1109/UPINLBS.2016.7809973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7809973","","Neural networks;Buildings;Euclidean distance;Position measurement;Backpropagation;Training;Transmission line measurements","backpropagation;indoor navigation;neural nets;wireless LAN","backpropagation neural networks;fingerprinting based WIPS;fingerprinting-based indoor positioning;WLAN/Wi-Fi signal strength;FWIPS;radio map construction;offline stage;localization task;online stage;training radio map;coordinate vectors;access points;BPNN;region of interest;discrete radio map filtering;discrete radio map densification;discrete radio map decimation;TRM;artificial neural networks;design parameters;hidden layers;hidden nodes;training procedure;weighted k nearest neighbor approach;BPNN-RM;weighted-kNN;BPNN-LA","","5","","27","","9 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Air quality monitoring stations are often confined to a small number of locations due to the high cost of the monitoring equipment.

However, recent developments in low-cost sensor technology and wireless communication systems like Internet of Things (IoT) provide an opportunity to use arrayed sensor networks to measure air pollution, in real time, at a large number of locations. This article reports the development of a novel low-cost sensor node that utilizes cost-effective electrochemical sensors to measure carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentrations and an infrared sensor to measure particulate matter (PM) levels. The node can be powered by either solar-recharged battery or mains supply. It is capable of long-range, low power communication over public or private long-range wide area network (LoRaWAN) IoT network and short-range high data rate communication over Wi-Fi. The developed sensor nodes were co-located with an accurate reference CO sensor for field calibration. The low-cost sensors' data, with offset and gain calibration, show good correlation with the data collected from the reference sensor. Multiple linear regression (MLR)-based temperature and humidity correction results in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 48.71% and R<sup>2</sup> of 0.607 relative to the reference sensor's data.

However, these solutions lack extensibility, and cannot therefore be easily applied to new Wi-Fi standards such as IEEE 802.11ac. Furthermore, while several practical RA solutions have been proposed for IEEE 802.11ac network interface cards (NICs), e.g., Minstrel and Iwlwifi, they achieve poor goodput performance in some cases since they lack scalability or thoroughness. Given a large number of rates in IEEE 802.11ac, the lack of scalability results in a slow convergence on the search of the best rate over time. To accelerate the rate search, several RA solutions skip some rates to narrow down the scope of candidate rates, but lack thoroughness and may miss the best rate. Accordingly, the present study proposes a holistic RA solution, designated as Machine Learning-based RA (MLRA), which is not only practical, but also extensible, scalable and thorough. MLRA achieves the extensible property by leveraging machine learning to automatically identify the correlations among the rate, goodput performance and link quality. Moreover, it achieves the scalable and thorough properties using a two-level rate search procedure and a congestion detector. The performance of MLRA is evaluated on commodity IEEE 802.11ac NICs using TensorFlow with an asynchronous framework implemented across the kernel and user spaces of the operating system.

To address these problems, we suggest well utilizing the richer regional features rather than the raw RSSs.

Wi-Fi spy cameras are used extensively by various adversaries because of easy installability, followed by size reduction. To prevent invasions of privacy, most studies have detected wireless cameras based on video traffic analysis and require additional synchronous data from external sensors or stimulus hardware to confirm the user’s motion. Such supplements make the users uncomfortable, requiring extra effort and time for setting. This paper proposes an effective spy camera detection system called <italic>DeepDeSpy</italic> to detect the recording of a spy camera with no effort from the user. The core idea is using the channel state information (CSI) and the network traffic from the camera to detect whether the wireless camera records the movements of the user. The CSI signal is prone to motion, and detecting motion from an enormous amount of CSI data in real-time is challenging. This was handled by leveraging the convolutional neural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) deep learning methods. Such synergistic CNN and BiLSTM deep learning models enable instant and accurate detection by automatically extracting meaningful features from the sequential raw CSI data. The feasibility of <italic>DeepDeSpy</italic> was verified by implementing it on both a PC and a smartphone and evaluating it in real-life scenarios (e.g., various room sizes and user physical activities).

By analyzing how gesture alters the WiFi propagation among WiFi-enabled IoT devices to identify the gestures in a device-free manner could be a promising solution. However, existing methods require tedious data collection and labeling process each time being implemented in a new environment. The classifier constructed by SVM or random forest is vulnerable to spatial dynamics. In this paper, we proposed JADA, a novel unsupervised Joint adversarial domain adaptation (JADA) scheme that realizes accurate and resilient WiFi-enabled device-free gesture recognition without collecting and labeling training data in new environments. After constructing a source encoder and a source classifier in the source domain by convolutional neural network, JADA trains a target encoder and also fine-tunes the source encoder through adversarial learning to map both unlabeled target data and labeled source data to a domain-invariant feature space such that a domain discriminator cannot distinguish the domain labels of the data. After training a shared classifier with the labeled source data while fixing the parameters of the source encoder, we employ the trained target encoder to embed the test target samples into the domain-invariant feature space and infer its class using the shared classifier. We develop a novel Channel State Information (CSI) enabled IoT platform that could obtain fine-grained CSI time series data directly from IoT devices and transform them into CSI frames. Real-world experiments with COTS WiFi routers were conducted in 2 indoor environments. The experimental results demonstrate that JADA achieves 98.75% gesture recognition accuracy in the original environment. Moreover, when the environmental scenario is altered, it is able to reduce the domain discrepancy across domains without collecting any labeled data in the new context.","","978-1-5386-6805-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614062","adversarial domain adaptation;gesture recognition;WiFi","Gesture recognition;Wireless fidelity;Labeling;Antenna measurements;Training data;Training;Time series analysis","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;gesture recognition;image classification;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);time series;wireless LAN","human gesture recognition;WiFi-enabled IoT devices;JADA;source encoder;source classifier;source domain;domain-invariant feature space;domain labels;shared classifier;WiFi-enabled device-free gesture recognition;joint adversarial domain adaptation scheme;target encoder;CSI time series data;channel state information;adversarial learning;convolutional neural network","","4","","31","","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we focus on score fusion method, which merges authentication scores of each factor in multi-factor authentication. In conventional score fusion methods, the weight of each factor is fixed. These methods work well when all users have a similar tendency for each factor. However, behavioral authentication is highly dependent on each user's characteristics, and the tendency of which factors have high accuracy may differ greatly among users. There is no score fusion method suitable for such a case where the tendency of each factor is different. We propose a user dependent weighting score fusion method using a neural network. Since our proposed method constructs a simple binary classification network for each user, the weight is personally adjusted for each user.

In this paper, a novel fingerprinting system is proposed to achieve indoor localization via learning spatiotemporal features from channel state information (CSI) of multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels (CSI-MIMO) by a dual-stream three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (DS-3DCNN). In the proposed system, the gathered raw CSI-MIMO data are firstly preprocessed through amplitude outliers elimination and phase sanitization for constructing a pair of 3D CSI-MIMO matrices including a 3D amplitude matrix and a 3D phase matrix. Next, the 3D matrices will be input to the DS-3DCNN deep neural network which consists of two parallel subnetworks with specific architecture of several convolution, batch normalization, max-pooling, and fully connected layers. Through this DS-3DCNN network, learning spatiotemporal features of CSI-MIMO is carried out simultaneously from 3D amplitude and phase matrices. And then, probabilistic classification results of two subnetworks are fused in the final output layer of the proposed DS-3DCNN based on Bayes' theorem. Moreover, in the offline training stage, a dual-stream joint optimization method is presented for efficiently optimizing network parameters. After offline training of the DS-3DCNN, in the online locating stage, current CSI-MIMO data are firstly collected from the mobile device to be located. Then probabilistic classification results are obtained from the output layer of the DS-3DCNN, and further used to approximate the posterior distribution of the mobile device's location with a Gaussian mixture model. Finally, a novel location estimation algorithm is deduced based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion. Since unique features of wireless MIMO channels are jointly learnt in spatial, temporal, and frequency domains, the proposed DS-3DCNN based fingerprinting system is reasonable to provide accurate localization results in indoor environments, which is verified in corresponding experiments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2946870","Scientific Research Project of Liaoning Provincial Department of Education of China(grant numbers:LYB201616); Public Sentiment and Network Security Big Data System Engineering Laboratory of Liaoning Province of China(grant numbers:2016(294)); China Scholarship Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8864050","Indoor localization;deep learning;convolutional neural network (CNN);channel state information (CSI)","Three-dimensional displays;Wireless communication;MIMO communication;Mobile handsets;Wireless fidelity;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Probabilistic logic","Bayes methods;convolutional neural nets;estimation theory;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);least mean squares methods;matrix algebra;MIMO communication;mixture models;mobile handsets;optimisation;probability;radio direction-finding;telecommunication computing;wireless channels","spatiotemporal feature learning;dual-stream 3D convolutional neural networks;WiFi-based indoor localization;multiple-input multiple-output wireless channels;three-dimensional convolutional neural network;phase sanitization;3D amplitude matrix;3D phase matrix;DS-3DCNN deep neural network;phase matrices;wireless MIMO channels;DS-3DCNN based fingerprinting system;CSI-MIMO data;amplitude outlier elimination;MMSE;minimum mean square error","","7","","43","CCBY","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The computational cost of fingerprint database is unacceptable as well. In this paper, we propose a novel method of Wi-Fi indoor localization based on CSI. A fast orthogonal search (FOS) algorithm is utilized to calculate the weights of CSI raw data collected from the wireless network interface card (NIC), reducing the database at the same time. Different weights of the features are then used as the input of a back-propagation (BP) neural network, conducting weighted training.

To identify the minority of a person, the measurement of bone age using X-ray imaging is the gold-standard procedure. Beside several technical and judicial problems like radiation, this technique still requires medical diagnosis and limits the acceptance and practicability. Existing ultrasound systems for bone age determination evaluate changes of speed of sound through bone showing unreliable results for majority determining. In this work a mobile ultrasound system for the purpose of fast and reliable majority determination is developed and clinically evaluated using machine learning for classification without the need of a physician trained for age determination. In women, the complete fusion of the distal growth plate in ulna and radius bones correlates with reaching the age of 18. The existence of this growth plate is measured using the developed mobile multichannel ultrasound system. Its main parts are a low cost and low power FPGA, a fully integrated 8 channel transceiver and a WIFI module for data transfer to a mobile device. A pair of ultrasound array transducers (4 elements with 11x11 mm aperture each, 1 MHz center frequency) is positioned and moved up to 15 mm for reflection and transmission measurements through the forearm resulting in measurements of multiple paths through an existing growth plate leading to more robust results. The detection of growth plate existence was done using machine learning approaches. Different types of artificial neural nets were used. The system has been evaluated successfully in a clinical study with 149 women at Saarland University Medical Center. Classical signal processing analyzing the change of ultrasound signals during transducer movement over the growth plate showed that a difference between underage and legal age women is contained in the data, but classification had to be done using machine learning methods. The best performance for binary majority classification was achieved using a ResNet with an F1 score of approximately 84 % showing the capabilities of the setup. Currently, a multi-center study started to increase the number of data used for training the artificial neural nets, improving these results further while adapting the technology even to male subject groups.","1948-5727","978-1-7281-4596-9","10.1109/ULTSYM.2019.8925868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925868","bone age;majority detection;growth plate;mobile ultrasound;machine learning","Ultrasonic imaging;Bones;Transducers;Ultrasonic variables measurement;Machine learning;Biomedical imaging;Reflection","biomedical measurement;biomedical transducers;biomedical ultrasonics;bone;field programmable gate arrays;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;mobile computing;neural nets;signal classification;transceivers;ultrasonic transducer arrays","ultrasound systems;bone age determination;distal growth plate;radius bones;low power FPGA;fully integrated 8 channel transceiver;mobile device;ultrasound array transducers;machine learning;artificial neural nets;ultrasound signals;binary majority classification;mobile multichannel ultrasound system;human trafficking;X-ray imaging;ulna bones;WIFI module;data transfer;signal processing;ResNet;frequency 1.0 MHz","","","","4","","8 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a Passive Wi-Fi Radar (PWR) technique for occupancy detection and people counting. Unlike systems which exploit the Wi-Fi Received Signal Strength (RSS) and Channel State Information (CSI), PWR systems can directly be applied in any environment covered by an existing WiFi local area network without special modifications to the Wi-Fi access point. Specifically, we apply Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF) processing to generate Range-Doppler maps, then we use Time-Frequency transforms to generate Doppler spectrograms, and finally employ a CLEAN algorithm to remove the direct signal interference. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and sliding-window based feature selection scheme is then used for classification.

This paper proposes a device-free localization method based on WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). In the area covered with WiFi, human movements may cause observable variations of WiFi signals. By analyzing the CSI fingerprint patterns and modelling the dependency between CSI fingerprints and locations through deep neural networks, the proposed method is able to estimate the objects' locations according to the measured CSI fingerprints through DNN regression. To cope with the noisy WiFi channels and remove the non-contributing information, the proposed method applies Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to reduce the noise in the raw CSI data, and applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the most contributing information in the CSI data. Evaluations in two representative scenarios achieved the mean distance error of 1.08 m and 1.50 m, respectively.","2155-5494","978-1-5386-4281-8","10.1109/SAHCN.2018.8397121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8397121","","Wireless fidelity;Principal component analysis;Neural networks;Training;Data models;Data preprocessing;Receiving antennas","neural nets;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;regression analysis;wireless channels;wireless LAN","deep neural networks;electronic devices;occasions device-free localization;WiFi Channel State Information;WiFi signals;CSI fingerprint patterns;noisy WiFi channels;raw CSI data;DNN regression;noncontributing information;density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise;principal component analysis;information extraction;mean distance error","","27","1","30","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The RSSI fingerprinting is one of many techniques used for indoor and outdoor localization. In addition, other fingerprints are used to assist in the localization collected from several sources such as camera, radar, and Lidar. Ideally, a combination of these sources is used to locate the same object. Precisely, these sources are collecting the same data using different dimensions ultimately building upon one big system. Due to different dimensions set by these sources, it often becomes difficult to train the overall system to achieve the task of localization. In this paper, we propose a technique that can be used to incorporate training multiple datasets from different dimensions (e.g. Lidar, camera, and radar) into one global dataset, then train it all at once. This technique is known as the Manifold Alignment. Our proposed manifold alignment algorithm bridges the gap, allowing the inclusion of multiple datasets in our application whilst constraining the computational time and storage that would be required for the system. We assume that our technique is embedded into our system and localization is achieved through either computing our proposed Manifold Alignment algorithm over a local device, edge server, or cloud. Results in this paper show how well the Manifold Alignment Algorithm is beneficial for a localization problem where it is implemented inside a machine learning model that computes the manifold of these datasets.","2576-7046","978-1-7281-5442-8","10.1109/CCECE47787.2020.9255684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9255684","Manifold Alignment;RSSI;Unsupervised learning;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning","Wireless fidelity;Sensors;Manifolds;Cloud computing;Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Training","indoor navigation;radionavigation;RSSI;telecommunication computing;unsupervised learning;wireless LAN","global dataset;manifold alignment algorithm;computational time;local device;localization problem;unsupervised manifold alignment;RSSI fingerprinting;outdoor localization;training multiple datasets;WiFi RSSI indoor localization;indoor localization;data collection;edge server;machine learning model","","2","","23","","19 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One use case of interest relates to the discernment between different wireless technologies that share the spectrum. Although highly accurate DNN classifiers have been proposed, preliminary research points to the vulnerability of these classifiers to adversarial machine learning (AML) attacks. In one such attack, a surrogate DNN model is trained by the attacker to produce intelligently crafted low-power “perturbations” that degrade the classification accuracy of the legitimate classifier. In this paper, we design four DNN-based classifiers for the identification of Wi-Fi, 5G NR-Unlicensed (NR-U), and LTE LAA transmissions over the 5 GHz UNII bands. Our DNN models include both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as well as several recurrent neural networks (RNNs) models, particularly LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) networks. We demonstrate the high classification accuracy of these models under “benign” (non-adversarial) noise. We then study the efficacy of these classifiers under AML-based perturbations. Specifically, we use the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) to generate adversarial perturbations. Different attack scenarios are studied, depending on how much information the attacker has about the defender's classifier. In one extreme scenario, called “white-box” attack, the attacker has full knowledge of the defender's DNN, including its hyperparameters, its training dataset, and even the seeds used to train the network. This attack is shown to significantly degrade the classification accuracy even when the FGSM-based perturbations are low power, i.e., the received SNR is relatively high. We then consider more realistic attack scenarios, where the attacker has partial or no knowledge of the defender's classifier. Even under limited knowledge, adversarial perturbations can still lead to significant reduction in the classification accuracy, relative to classification under AWGN with the same SNR level.","2155-7586","978-1-6654-3956-5","10.1109/MILCOM52596.2021.9653072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9653072","Deep learning;signal classification;adversarial machine learning;shared spectrum;wireless security","Training;Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks;Protocols;Perturbation methods;Convolutional neural networks;Jamming","","","","","","19","","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current works are mostly designed for single human environment owing to the complexity of multiple human environment and in turn greatly hinder this technology from real implementation. To realize such device-free sensing in a multiple human environment, the first step-stone is to estimate how many targets or in other words crowd counting, which is not only the basis for multiple human environmental sensing but also lead to many potential applications such as crowd control. Previous efforts for crowd counting using WiFi failed to do so, as the robustness of their method is limited. To this end, we propose WiCount - the first solution using a deep learning approach to infer the number of people robustly in the room with WiFi signals. Our scheme is based on the key intuition that now that it is too complex to model the crowd counting using WiFi directly, we can use deep learning approaches to construct a complex function to fit the correlation between the number of people and Channel State Information (CSI) values. The prototype of WiCount is implemented and evaluated on the commercial WiFi device. The experimental results show that our deep learning model is able to estimate the number of crowd up to 5 with the accuracy of 82.3% in a rather effective and robust manner.","","978-1-5386-3790-6","10.1109/ISPA/IUCC.2017.00148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8367378","Crowd Counting;WiFi signals;Neural Network","Wireless fidelity;Sensors;Machine learning;Robustness;Training;Neural networks;Receiving antennas","learning (artificial intelligence);ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN","crowd counting;Channel State Information;CSI;single human environment;device-free manner;intelligent environments;wireless sensing;recent research efforts;ubiquitous WiFi devices;deep learning model;commercial WiFi device;WiCount;WiFi signals;deep learning approach;crowd control;multiple human environmental sensing;device-free sensing;multiple human environment","","17","","20","","28 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At any time, MHS could be enabled as Wi-Fi Hotspot in mobility devices (smart phone, tablet) with cellular backhaul network (3G/4G/5G) and provides Internet access to client devices such as laptop, TV etc. Unlike Wi-Fi Access Point, which is typically a powered device, MHS is enabled as battery-operated device. In addition, MHS consumes higher power and reported as one of the primary Voice of Customer (VoC) issue. Due to high power consumption, many customers are skeptical about MHS feature and its continuous usage. Apart from few literatures, there is no specific IEEE 802.11 standard for MHS and its power management.

However, the tradeoff between running a deep neural network on the smartwatch verses sending the sensor data to the back-end server for processing is not well understood. This paper presents a case study of these tradeoffs for a Samsung S3 smartwatch in the context of a word recognition task using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on Google's Speech Command data set. Tensorflow.js was used to do edge inference on the watch and under various computational offloading conditions using 2G, Edge, 3G and WiFi profiles. The results are that running a CNN on the watch is superior in terms of memory, CPU, inference time, and battery depletion. In specific, the inference time was 3 times longer for 2G and 1.6 times longer for WiFi with computational offloading. In addition, the battery depletion rate was about the same when using 2G or Edge Lossy but was 60-70% worse when using 3G or WiFi for computational offloading.","","978-1-7281-4985-1","10.1109/ICAIIC48513.2020.9064970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9064970","Deep learning;smartwatch;computational offloading;tensorflow;convolutional neural networks","Sensors;Batteries;Wireless fidelity;3G mobile communication;Memory management;Servers;Monitoring","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;smart phones","convolutional neural network;deep learning;deep neural network;smartwatch verses;back-end server;Samsung S3 smartwatch;word recognition task;CNN;edge inference;computational offloading conditions;WiFi;inference time;Google speech command data","","3","","24","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such a paradigm raises questions on safety and coordination, especially when in the presence of unexpected events. Time-critical communication messages for such industrial robots mandate the requirement of ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Classical WiFi-connected industrial robots often suffer from the traditional dense network problems prevalent in production WiFi networks, where transmission of an emergency notification packet is “best effort,” devoid of time guarantees. In this work, we propose a machine-learning-based framework called ReLy that intelligently embeds the time-critical messages in the preamble of outgoing frames at the transmitter. These messages are inferred from the channel state information variations at the receiver. As ReLy is implemented entirely at the physical layer, the transmitter is able to deliver information within 5 ms latency and ultra-high reliability of 99 percent. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of achieving URLLC with moving robots in a busy workshop with a number of other peer robots, equipment, desks, and robotic arms, as expected in a typical factory setting.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.2000598","Office of Naval Research(grant numbers:N000141612651); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9433524","","Service robots;Transmitters;Robot kinematics;Receivers;Ultra reliable low latency communication;Production facilities;Time factors;Machine learning","computer network reliability;factory automation;industrial robots;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;mobile radio;mobile robots;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;wireless LAN","ReLy;machine learning;robotic factory floors;manufacturing sector;unprecedented boost;unexpected events;time-critical communication messages;URLLC;classical WiFi-connected industrial robots;traditional dense network problems;production WiFi networks;emergency notification packet;machine-learning-based framework;time-critical messages;radio transmitter;channel state information variations;ultra-high reliability;peer robots;robotic arms;WiFi-connected industrial robots;channel state information;ultra-reliable low-latency communication;physical layer;typical factory setting;moving robots;busy workshop;time 5.0 ms","","1","","15","","17 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Wiga takes the fine-grained Channel State Information (CSI) as input and elaborates a deep learning network to map the motion-induced signal variations with the activity sequence. First, Wiga removes noise and redundancy of the raw CSI measurements. Then, after abstracting deep features with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Wiga exploits a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to model temporal dependencies of the sequence. In addition, Wiga employs the beam search method to get around error-prone temporal segments and obtains real-time activity sequence recognition. We evaluate Wiga with 17 yoga activities from 7 volunteers, and extensive experimental results show that Wiga achieves an average accuracy of 97.7% and 85.6% for trained and untrained users respectively with a recognition delay no more than 0.5s.","","978-1-7281-5212-7","10.1109/MSN48538.2019.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066065","Channel State Information;Contactless;Activity Sequence Recognition","Real-time systems;Principal component analysis;Windows;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Activity recognition;OFDM","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image classification;image motion analysis;image segmentation;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;search problems;sport;wireless LAN","quasiperiod activity;isolated activity monitoring;real-time auxiliary exercise system;aperiodic activity sequence;Wiga;deep learning network;error-prone temporal segments;WiFi-based contactless activity sequence recognition system;home exercise guidance;sports experience;yoga activities;long short term memory network;convolutional neural network","","1","","18","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Positioning errors of over 10 meters are reported in large-scale indoor environment such as airport and department stores. Compared to RF or ultrasound signals, the geomagnetic field signal exhibits stable signal strength in time domain. However, the existing geomagnetic field based indoor localization still relies on the fingerprinting technique, which is borrowed from the RF-based indoor positioning. This cannot resolve the distribution of the same geomagnetic field values and thus became a major reason for diminished performance of geomagnetic- based indoor localization. In this paper, we propose a novel indoor localization technique that uses magnetometer sensor readings as input to the artificial neural network models. The idea is that although there can be multiple locations having the same magnetic field value, as a pedestrian moves the sequence of magnetic field values will lead to a unique pattern of the sensor readings over time. We use a recurrent neural network (RNN) since it can characterize a particular location based on the current input as well as the past sequence of inputs. We first build a geomagnetic field map on our campus test-bed. Then, we generate a million traces of various pedestrian walking patterns from the map. We use Google Tensorflow with NVIDIA cuDNN library as a Deep Learning framework. 95% of the traces are used for training and 5% of the traces are used for localization evaluation. In this preliminary evaluation, we show an average positioning error of 1.062 meters compared to the average error of 3.14 meters of our BLE fingerprinting results. We cannot only improve the localization accuracy but we are also able to address the problem of continuous route tracking, which was not possible with the RF-based fingerprinting.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254556","","Fingerprint recognition;Radio frequency;Magnetic fields;Recurrent neural networks;Meters;RF signals;Magnetic field measurement","geomagnetic navigation;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);magnetometers;recurrent neural nets","recurrent neural network;RF signals;indoor positioning techniques;Wi-Fi fingerprinting;large-scale indoor environment;ultrasound signals;time domain;fingerprinting technique;artificial neural network models;geomagnetic field map;indoor localization technique;geomagnetic field signal;signal strength;NVIDIA cuDNN library;Google Tensorflow;deep learning framework;BLE fingerprinting;route tracking","","23","","22","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reservoir computing (RC), a special type of RNN, and extreme learning machine (ELM), a special type of feedforward neural network, are chosen as the corresponding building blocks to facilitate over-the-air training. An online training loss objective is introduced to recursively update the neural weights in real-time. We believe this is the first work in the literature to realize real-time machine learning for MIMO-OFDM symbol detection, i.e., conducting NN-based symbol detection on an OFDM symbol basis. We demonstrate that (1) the IEEE standardized WiFi training sequence can be directly applied as the real-time training sequence (2) the symbol detection performance can be further improved by using our theoretically derived pilot pattern.

Without new methods to manage this shared spectrum, wireless communication is increasingly challenging as too many nodes attempt at accessing the same spectrum. Collaboration between different wireless networks that use the same spectrum will be required to handle this massive amount of devices. In this paper, we present two algorithms based on Neural Networks (NNs) to demonstrate that a function approximation can accurately predict free slots in a Multiple Frequencies Time Division Multiple Access (MF-TDMA) network. By observing the spectrum, we are able to do online learning and let the corresponding NN predict the behavior of the spectrum a second in advance using our approach. We are able to reduce the number of collisions by half if the nodes from other networks are sending data following a Poisson distribution. When the nodes of the other network follow a more periodic traffic pattern, a collision reduction of factor 15 could be achieved.","1558-2612","978-1-5386-1734-2","10.1109/WCNC.2018.8377044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8377044","","Schedules;Wireless networks;Throughput;Interference;Artificial neural networks;Time division multiple access","neural nets;Poisson distribution;radio spectrum management;telecommunication scheduling;time division multiple access","wireless communication;Neural Networks;Multiple Frequencies Time Division Multiple Access network;MF-TDMA MAC scheduler;collaborative wireless networks;unlicensed spectrum;wireless technologies;wireless transmission","","10","","17","","11 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It's observed that, in spite of the inevitable quantization error in the positioning process, the mean positioning error is still as accurate as 1.1 cm.

In this paper, a new WiFi-based and video-based neural network (WiNN) is proposed to improve the robustness of activity recognition where the synchronized video serves as the supplement for the wireless data. Moreover, a wireless-vision benchmark (WiVi) is collected for 9 class actions recognition in three different visual conditions, including the scenes without occlusion, with partial occlusion, and with full occlusion. Both machine learning method - support vector machine (SVM) as well as deep learning methods are used for the accuracy verification of the data set. Our results show that WiVi data set satisfies the primary demand and all three branches in proposed pipeline keep more than 80% of activity recognition accuracy over multiple action segmentation from Is to 3s.

Existing approaches usually require specialized equipment and heavy deployment overhead, making them hard to scale for wide deployment. The recent WiFi-based approach is unsuitable for practical deployment as it did not address dynamic environmental impacts. In this work, we propose an environment-independent in-baggage object identification system by leveraging low-cost WiFi. We exploit the channel state information (CSI) to capture material and shape characteristics to facilitate fine-grained inbaggage object identification. A major challenge of building such a system is that CSI measurements are sensitive to real-world dynamics, such as different types of baggage, time-varying ambient noises and interferences, and different deployment environments. To tackle these problems, we develop WiFi features based on polarized directional antennas that can capture objects’ material and shape characteristics. A convolutional neural network-based model is developed to constructively integrate the WiFi features and perform accurate in-baggage object identification. We also develop a material-based domain adaptation using adversarial learning to facilitate fast deployments in different environments. We conduct extensive experiments involving 14 representation objects, 4 types of bags in 3 different room environments. The results show that our system can achieve over 97% in the same environment, and our domain adaptation method can improve the object identification accuracy by 42% when the system is deployed in a new environment with little training.","2155-6814","978-1-6654-4935-9","10.1109/MASS52906.2021.00018","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637801","WiFi Sensing;Object Identification","Training;Adaptation models;Shape;Safety;Object recognition;Convolutional neural networks;Noise measurement","convolutional neural nets;directive antennas;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","time-varying ambient noises;deployment environments;WiFi features;convolutional neural network-based model;material-based domain adaptation;fast deployments;room environments;object identification accuracy;WiFi signals;low-cost in-baggage object identification;public safety;smart manufacturing;specialized equipment;heavy deployment overhead;recent WiFi-based approach;dynamic environmental impacts;environment-independent in-baggage object identification system;low-cost WiFi;channel state information;shape characteristics;fine-grained inbaggage object identification;CSI measurements;real-world dynamics;representation objects","","","","24","IEEE","13 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this scenario, a controller is identified, whose goal is to manage the D2D connection after its establishment. The software defined networking paradigm makes it possible to select this controller node via software: a device becomes the master node of a Wi-Fi-direct network, whereas the remaining units, i.e., the clients, can exchange data with other devices through the master. This paper develops a machine learning-based prediction algorithm for the aforementioned scenario, in which multiple elements, while receiving data from the controller, require an accurate on-the-fly estimation of the remaining transmission time, i.e., the estimated time of arrival. Different machine learning approaches are considered for this task, with the goal of exploiting only the information available at each client, without modifying any standard communication protocol. This information is critical when, for instance, a mobile user needs to decide whether or not to delay a data transfer, based on the load of the network and on the residual time under radio coverage from an access point.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2017.2734645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8002627","Cognitive networking;estimated time of arrival;network optimization;machine learning","Wireless fidelity;Device-to-device communication;Protocols;Wireless communication;Software;Smart phones;Quality of service","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;wireless LAN","device to device communication;machine learning;standard communication protocol;on-the-fly estimation;Wi-Fi-direct network;master node;controller node;network infrastructure;transmitting node;D2D;Wi-Fi Transmissions;ETA estimator;residual time;data transfer","","4","","36","IEEE","4 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Today, many communication protocols (e.g., IEC 61850, OPC UA, Modbus, Internet, WiMAX, 4G, Wi-Fi, etc.) and technologies (e.g., PLC, GSM, Optic fiber, RF radio mesh, Cellular, etc.) are established for the smart grid applications. In case of the stability guarantee of smart grid, the Quality of Service (QoS) is a challenge to be considered. One of the major concerns in data delivery over the network is a low latency message transmission to ensure the time critical tasks, e.g., control and protection tasks. In this context, the main contribution of this paper is to propose a model methodology for the communication network delay in smart grid applications. To be compatible with the further goal of delay predictive compensation method, the present paper proposes a message transmission delay estimation method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. To this end, Python is the chosen programming language, including its required libraries for the considered application. Delay values measured on a real-time HV/MV substation application are used as input data for validation purpose.","","978-1-6654-3613-7","10.1109/EEEIC/ICPSEurope51590.2021.9584791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584791","smart grid;Internet;message transmission delay;time-series forecasting;Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)","Protocols;Neural networks;Quality of service;Predictive models;Delays;Smart grids;Communication networks","delay estimation;delays;power engineering computing;protocols;quality of service;recurrent neural nets;smart power grids;stability;substation automation;substations","resilient communication infrastructure;communication protocols;smart grid applications;communication network delay;message transmission delay estimation method;Long Short-Term Memory neural network;smart control;power grid;quality of service;delay predictive compensation method;data delivery","","","","19","IEEE","3 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Receiving directions and/or being recognized within indoor spaces is one feature of smart spaces that is currently heavily researched. Indoor positioning systems (IPS) can be used to provide a wide range of user navigation and directions services, particularly in abnormal conditions such as needing emergency healthcare services and being in unfamiliar complex buildings where some may become disoriented or lost. IPS also can be a friendly tool for people with vision impairment to allow for better livable communities for them. Other applications for IPS fall under tracking applications which may include activity recognition for security purposes and observation for the elderly or infirmed individuals. An indoor positioning system can be a hybrid system that uses multiple technologies such as wireless LAN, vision via cameras, motion sensors, or lasers to name few. In this paper we propose a technique for IPS using WiFi. The technique is based on a probabilistic neural network (PNN) scheme in which we incorporate the Jensen-Shannon divergence method. To validate our proposed method, we compare our results with the nearest neighbor method. Results indicate that our integrated system outperforms this method in terms of nearest neighbor estimation.

To overcome this problem, 802.11 stations need to confirm the channel availability through the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) mechanism. Besides energy detection, which has low sensitivity, packet detection in Wi-Fi also utilizes a more sensitive preamble correlation method to check for a valid data symbol within 4μs. Hence, a successful CCA is only possible if the received signal exceeds a certain power level or the contending station could receive the signal preamble. In this paper, we demonstrate how a deep learning-based method like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be used to supplement Wi-Fi's CCA capability to increase its sensitivity without requiring the reception of the signal preamble. We also elaborate on the role of filter size and max-pooling in signal processing points of view. Our simulations show that the proposed CNN model can classify different packet formats and their modulation types, even when different symbol timing offsets occur. Based on the ns-3 simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed approach leads to better channel utilization and enhanced throughput in a multiple BSS network by prioritizing high throughput transmissions.","2694-2941","978-1-7281-9441-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops50388.2021.9473621","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9473621","OBSS;WLAN;CNN;modulation detection;OFDM","Sensitivity;Parameter estimation;Conferences;OFDM;Modulation;Throughput;Timing","convolutional neural nets;correlation methods;filtering theory;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless channels;wireless LAN","asynchronous packet parameter identification;Dense Wi-Fi;packet collisions;Basic Service Set interference;decreased network efficiency;channel availability;clear channel assessment mechanism;energy detection;packet detection;sensitive preamble correlation method;valid data symbol;received signal;power level;contending station;signal preamble;deep learning-based method;different packet formats;different symbol timing offsets;channel utilization;Wi-Fi CCA capability;convolutional neural network;multiple BSS network;time 4.0 mus","","1","","13","","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to reduce the online identification time, our framework adopts a re-weighted ℓ<sub>1</sub>-norm regularization, which considers the number of samples and computation cost of different features. This framework jointly optimizes feature selection and prediction performance in a unified objective function. To tackle the packet interarrival time uncertainty when optimizing the trade-off between the identification accuracy and delay, we utilize maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)method to estimate the packet inter-arrival time.

This device is being powered by a 5V 16,000mAh Li-ion battery power supply. The 2 channel signal from the analog frontend was transferred to a computer server for data collection. Lead II data were then stored as a 6-seconds ECG epoch (1536 samples) in order to visualize and classified with a pre-trained CNN. There were two CNN models with a residual network architecture (ResNet) conducted in this study: SmallNet and BigNet. SmallNet classified an ECG signal into 3 classes which are normal, abnormal, and noise, then reported them in a probability form on the displaying screen. BigNet can be used to identify 10 different types of arrhythmia which are normal, left bundle branch block beat, right bundle branch block beat, atrial premature beat, premature ventricular contraction, ventricular escape beat, a fusion of ventricular and normal beat, paced beat, other abnormal beat and noise. This platform was a preliminary step of a bedside ECG monitoring platform that can visualize the ECG signal with a probability of normal, abnormal and noise with an accuracy of 99.1%, which can be adapted for a reduction of the false alarm rate.

To solve this problem, a few recent studies have used machine learning to reduce the number of samples collected at each reference point. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the number of reference points that need to be investigated. We collect channel state information (CSI) at a few reference points sparsely and convert it into a CSI amplitude image. Then, the generative adversarial network (GAN) interpolates the values between each reference point by learning these CSI amplitude images and walking in the latent space to synthesize a dense fingerprint map for improved localization accuracy.

As a consequence, providing access to the radio spectrum is becoming increasingly more important. The ever-growing wireless traffic and the increasing scarcity of available spectrum warrants efficient management of the radio spectrum. At the same time, machine learning (ML) is becoming ubiquitous and has found applications in many fields for its ability to identify patterns and assist with decision-making processes. Recently, machine learning algorithms have been used to address challenges in the wireless communications domain, such as radio spectrum sensing, and have shown better performance than traditional sensing methods, such as energy detection. Spectrum sensing, a method for detecting and identifying different wireless signals being transmitted in the same band of the radio spectrum, is crucial for improving dynamic spectrum sharing, which has the potential to enhance sharing and coexistence of different wireless technologies in the same frequency band and ultimately improve spectrum efficiency. To this end, this research evaluates different types of autoencoders, such as deep, variational and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoders, to identify and differentiate between LTE and Wi-Fi transmissions. The goal is to investigate the performance of the different types of autoencoders on an I/Q dataset consisting of LTE and a combination of Wi-Fi signals (IEEE 802.11ax and IEEE 802.11ac) for the classification task in terms of complexity, precision, and recall to identify the best algorithm.

In addition, machine learning techniques can improve the accuracy of indoor localization systems using multiview CSI data received at multiple access points (APs). However, in complex environments, most CSI views collected at APs in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) configurations relative to a transmitter may lose so much useful data information as to become nonsalient. In this paper, we propose a practical machine learning approach named unsupervised view-selective deep learning (UVSDL), in which only the most salient CSI view is selected in an unsupervised manner to be applied in regression for localization. In an experiment in a complex building, our variational deep learning (VDL)-based regression method with the most salient CSI view achieves a localization accuracy of 1.36 m, significantly outperforming the best-known system BiLoc by 25 %.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3112994","Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT), South Korea, under the Information Technology Research Center (ITRC) Support Program IITP-2021-2018-0-01402 supervised by the Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9539201","Indoor localization system;channel state information (CSI);multiview data;complex building environment;machine learning;variational deep learning;unsupervised clustering;salient view selection","Location awareness;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Training;Deep learning;Antenna measurements;Receiving antennas","deep learning (artificial intelligence);indoor radio;regression analysis;unsupervised learning;wireless LAN","salient CSI view;localization accuracy;practical indoor localization;high-dimensional data characteristics;channel state information;Wi-Fi signals;machine learning techniques;indoor localization systems;multiview CSI data;multiple access points;CSI views;nonline-of-sight configurations;useful data information;practical machine learning approach;variational deep learning-based regression method;unsupervised view-selective deep learning;distance 1.36 m","","","","75","IEEE","15 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since each human motion within the signal coverage would cause different wireless channel disturbances, it is possible to identify and interpret these activity-induced signal changes for human behavior recognition. Although many approaches attempt to extract distinct patterns from WiFi measurements corresponding to user activities, the signals can be easily attenuated due to environmental variations in the real settings, so that their recognition accuracy may be severely deteriorated. In order to extract the key features in a more distinguished way, in this paper, we propose WiWave, a WiFi-based device-free HAR system leveraging wavelet integrated convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead of utilizing pooling operations, our proposed network has introduced discrete wavelet transform (DWT) into the convolutional architectures, which can combine the good time-frequency local characteristics of the wavelet transform with the self-learning ability of the neural network. Consequently, not only high-level features from low-frequency components can be obtained automatically, but also the the size of feature map can be reduced. The experiment results demonstrate that WiWave achieves average 94.87% accuracy for distinguishing ten actions in real-world home environment.","2474-9133","978-1-6654-3944-2","10.1109/ICCCWorkshops52231.2021.9538931","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Beijing Institute of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9538931","Channel state information;human activity recognition;discrete wavelet transform;down-sampling;device-free sensing","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Convolution;Neural networks;Activity recognition;Feature extraction;Discrete wavelet transforms","convolutional neural nets;discrete wavelet transforms;feature extraction;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);wavelet transforms;wireless LAN","WiWave;WiFi-based human activity recognition;wavelet integrated CNN;human motion;activity-induced signal changes;human behavior recognition;WiFi measurements;user activities;recognition accuracy;WiFi-based device-free HAR system;wavelet integrated convolutional neural network;discrete wavelet transform;DWT;time-frequency local characteristics;self-learning ability","","","","24","","23 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Cognitive Radios (CRs), learning is necessary for its cognition, while two of the key challenges are how to classify primary user agents with their performances and predict their behaviors. The CRs' performance has a positive correlation with the hit rate of learning algorithm's classification and prediction results.

We apply the DBN model to improve accuracy rating of user agent's recognition in CRs with user-centered model, it's the first application of deep learning structure in CRs. The DBN model provides a primary user agent's classification, which is the foundation of the prediction to both idle frequency spectrums and time slots.

This can be attributed to unstable received signal strengths (RSS) of the underlying RF signal, which is enlarged with the increased physical scale and the complexity of the indoor space. In this paper, instead of RF signal we use the geomagnetic sensor signal for indoor localization, whose signal strength is more stable than RF RSS. Our approach using the geomagnetic field is as follows. Although similar geomagnetic field values exist in indoor space, an object movement would experience a unique sequence of the geomagnetic field signals as the movement continues. We can locate the position of the object by tracking the geomagnetic field signal sequence sensed with the object movement by using a deep neural network model called recurrent neural network (RNN), which is good at recognizing time varying sequence of sensor data. We use two different versions of RNN model: basic RNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We have trained RNNs to learn the magnetic field maps of both medium scale (about 94m x 26m) and large scale (about 608m x 50m area) indoor testbeds and analyze both training and test set results by tuning several training hyperparameters. For comparison, we have also implemented both Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Wi-Fi based fingerprinting localization techniques and measured their localization accuracies for the testbeds. By using Google TensorFlow 1.6 and Nvdia CUDA Toolkit v9.0 with cuDNN v7.1 library as a deep learning framework, we could achieve the average localization accuracy of 0.51 and 1.04 meters for the medium and the large-scale testbeds respectively with LSTM model, substantially improving the localization performance compared to the existing RF based fingerprinting techniques.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761118","","IP networks;Fingerprint recognition;Meters;Radio frequency;RF signals;Wireless fidelity;Training","Bluetooth;indoor communication;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;RSSI;wireless LAN","deep neural networks;BLE;Wi-Fi fingerprinting;localization error;physical dimension;unstable received signal strengths;geomagnetic sensor signal;RF RSS;object movement;geomagnetic field signal sequence;deep neural network model;recurrent neural network;RNN model;basic RNN;magnetic field maps;Wi-Fi based fingerprinting localization techniques;localization accuracies;deep learning framework;large-scale testbeds;localization performance;geomagnetic field values;large scale indoor environment;RF signal based indoor localization techniques;large-scale indoor positioning","","13","","23","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fall detection system (FDS) that alerts caregivers or family members can potentially save lives of the elderly. However, conventional FDS involves wearable sensors and specialized hardware installations. This article presents a passive device-free FDS based on commodity WiFi framework for smart home, which is mainly composed of two modules in terms of hardware platform and client application. Concretely, commercial WiFi devices collect disturbance signal induced by human motions from smart home and transmit the data to a data analysis platform for further processing. Based on this basis, a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) method is used to eliminate the influence of random noise presented in the collected data. Next, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model is utilized to classify human motions and identify the fall status automatically. By leveraging Web Application Programming Interface (API), the analyzed data is able to be uploaded to the proxy server from which the client application then obtains the corresponding fall information. Moreover, the system has been implemented as a consumer mobile App that can help the elderly saving their lives in smart home, and detection performance of the proposed FDS has been evaluated by conducting comprehensive experiments on real-world dataset.

However, existing magnetic positioning methods cannot perform well in a wide space because the magnetic signal is not always discernible. In this paper, we introduce deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs) to build a model that is capable of capturing long-range dependencies in variable-length input sequences. The use of DRNNs is brought from the idea that the spatial/temporal sequence of magnetic field values around a given area will create a unique pattern over time, despite multiple locations having the same magnetic field value. Therefore, we can divide the indoor space into landmarks with magnetic field values and find the position of the user in a particular area inside the building. We present long short-term memory DRNNs for spatial/temporal sequence learning of magnetic patterns and evaluate their positioning performance on our testbed datasets.

A labor-intensive solution to this problem is collecting large number of RSS fingerprints that capture the variations in the new environment and the new mobile device. In this paper, we propose a RSS fingerprint generation method for the heterogeneous mobile device or new environment by limiting the RSS fingerprint sampling to a few locations. We accomplish this by utilizing a transformer neural network architecture for generating RSS samples.

The traditional WiFi fingerprint privacy protection scheme increases the calculation amount of the client, but cannot completely protect the security of the client and the fingerprint database. In this paper, we make use of WiFi devices to present a Practical Privacy Protection Scheme In WiFi Fingerprint-based Localization PPWFL. In PPWFL, the localization server establishes a pre-partition in the fingerprint database through the E-M clustering algorithm, we divide the entire fingerprint database into several partitions. The server uses WiFi fingerprint entries with partitions as training data and trains a machine learning model. This model can accurately predict the client's partition based on fingerprint entries. The client uses the trained machine learning model to obtain its partition location accurately, picks up WiFi fingerprint entries in its partition, and calculates its geographic location with the localization server through secure multi-party computing. Compared with the traditional solution, our solution only uses the WiFi fingerprint entries in the client's partition rather than the entire fingerprint database. PPWFL can reduce not only unnecessary calculations but also avoid accidental errors (Unexpected errors in fingerprint similarity between non-adjacent locations due to multipath effects of electromagnetic waves during the propagation of complex indoor environments) in fingerprint distance calculation. In particular, due to the use of Secure Multi-Party Computation, most of the calculations are performed in the local offline phase, the client only exchanges data with the localization server during the distance calculation phase. No additional equipment is needed; our solution uses only existing WiFi devices in the building to achieve fast localization based on privacy protection. We prove that PPWFL is secure under the honest but curious attacker. Experiments show that PPWFL achieves efficiency and accuracy than the traditional WiFi fingerprint localization scheme.","","978-1-7281-8206-3","10.1109/DSAA49011.2020.00080","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9260101","Location privacy;WiFi fingerprint localization;BayesNet;Secure multi-party calculation","Wireless fidelity;Databases;Servers;Privacy;Machine learning;Data privacy;Computational modeling","computer network security;data protection;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;wireless LAN","fingerprint distance calculation;Secure MultiParty Computation;local offline phase;localization server;WiFi devices;WiFi fingerprint database;indoor localization;traditional WiFi fingerprint privacy protection scheme;secure multiparty computing;WiFi fingerprint-based localization PPWFL;E-M clustering algorithm;training data;machine learning model;client partition prediction;geographic location;multipath effects;electromagnetic waves;distance calculation phase","","","","15","","20 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose TrueStory: a system that can accurately and robustly identify the user's floor level using the building's WiFi networks. TrueStory targets challenging environments where the access point (AP) density is not uniform and/or there are open areas that make the APs heard strongly in faraway floors. To handle these challenges, TrueStory employs a number of techniques including signal normalization, AP power equalization, and fusing various learners using a multilayer perceptron neural network. We present the design and implementation of TrueStory and evaluate its performance in three different testbeds. Our evaluation shows that TrueStory can accurately identify the user's exact floor level up to 91.8% of the time and within one floor error 99% of the time. This improves the floor estimation accuracy over the state-of-the-art systems and reduces the high floor errors by more than 23%.

The experimental results utilized the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID) to evaluate the performance of seven well-known machine learning classifiers, namely, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Random Tree, J48, logit Boost, Multi-Layer Perceptron, and ZeroR with respect to the selected features set. The presented work outperforms previous related work in terms of number of classes, features and accuracy. The proposed system using the Random Forest algorithm and 32 features achieves a maximum accuracy of 99.64%. By using logit Boost with five features, we achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.53%.","","978-1-5386-3779-1","10.1109/ISNCC.2018.8530969","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8530969","Intrusion Detection;AWID;Machine Learning;Features Selection;Random forest;J48","","computer network security;feature extraction;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;pattern classification;random processes;wireless LAN","effective features selection;machine learning classifiers;machine learning algorithms;wireless intrusion detection systems;computing resources;unauthorized access;multiclass classification;802.11 MAC layer attacks;802.11 frame fields information;logit Boost;Aegean Wi-Fi intrusion dataset;random forest algorithm;WIDS;AWID","","8","","26","","11 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these environments we typically use only one AP per service provider/residence for providing wireless services to the users. However, note that larger number of APs from multiple service providers/residences vie for bandwidth in any geographic region. Here we can reduce the cost of autonomic network control by equipping the same AP with a cognitive functionality. We first present architecture of our autonomous CogAP. Then we introduce our algorithmic solution, in which a Neural Network-based traffic predictor makes use of historical traffic traces to learn network traffic conditions and predicts traffic loads on each of 802.11 b/g channels. The cognitive decision engine makes use of traffic forecasts to dynamically decide which channel is best for CogAP to operate on for serving its clients. One of the challenges in autonomous cognitive decision making is the computation resource constraints in today's embedded APs. We have built a prototype CogAP device using cognitive software modules and off-the-self hardware components. We carried out performance evaluation of the proposed CogAP system by conducting experimental measurements on our testbed platform; the obtained results show that the proposed CogAP is effective in achieving performance enhancements with respect to state-of-the-art channel selection strategies.","1930-529X","978-1-4244-4148-8","10.1109/GLOCOM.2009.5425606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5425606","","Communication system traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless networks;Home automation;Bandwidth;Cost function;Neural networks;Engines;Decision making;Embedded computing","cognitive radio;neural nets;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","autonomous cognitive access point;Wi-Fi hotspots;cognitive networking paradigm;wireless network environment;home networks;service provider;wireless services;autonomic network control;cognitive functionality;autonomous CogAP;neural network based traffic predictor;historical traffic traces;network traffic conditions;802.11 b/g channels;cognitive decision engine;autonomous cognitive decision making;cognitive software modules;off-the-self hardware components;performance evaluation","","4","","11","","4 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a three-phase system Wi-multi that targets at recognizing multiple human activities in a wireless environment. Different system phases are applied according to the size of available collected samples. Specifically, distance-based classification using dynamic time warping is applied when there are few samples in the profile. Then, support vector machine is employed when representative features can be extracted from training samples. Lastly, recurrent neural networks is exploited when a large number of samples are available. Extensive experiments results show that Wi-multi achieves an accuracy of 96.1% on average.

In fingerprint positioning, a site-survey is conducted in advance to build the radio map which can be used to match radio signatures with specific locations. Thus, it can take the impacts of empirical indoor environments into consideration. However, even if the physical positional relationship in the indoor environment is static, the observed RSSI values are dynamically fluctuated according to the probabilistic wireless channels. Unfortunately, it is difficult to analytically capture the stochastic behavior of RSSI in real-environments, and the accuracy of position estimation is degraded due to the model errors. To tackle this challenging problem, machine learning-based logistic regression is applied to fingerprint positioning with the RSSI data set (available as big data). Additionally, by exploiting a unified fingerprint generated from both Wi-Fi and BLE beacon signals, further performance improvement in the estimation accuracy is possible, owing to the transmit diversity effects. The experimental results show the validity of the proposed positioning scheme with the unified Wi-Fi and BLE fingerprint.","2640-0103","978-1-7281-3248-8","10.1109/APSIPAASC47483.2019.9023051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9023051","","Wireless fidelity;Receivers;Computational modeling;Training;Testing;Training data;Estimation","Bluetooth;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);probability;radionavigation;regression analysis;RSSI;stochastic processes;wireless channels;wireless LAN","unified fingerprint;received signal strength indication fingerprints;Bluetooth low energy;fingerprint positioning;site-survey;radio map;empirical indoor environments;physical positional relationship;indoor environment;observed RSSI values;probabilistic wireless channels;position estimation;machine learning-based logistic regression;RSSI data set;BLE beacon signals;unified Wi-Fi;machine learning-aided indoor positioning scheme;radio signature matching;stochastic behavior;diversity effects","","2","","17","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Private LTE is a promising wireless network solution as it can be customised independently without the control of a mobile network operator while providing reliable and spectrum efficient services. For this reason, the deployment of Private LTE in the unlicensed spectrum and its coexistence with Wi-Fi is becoming a popular topic in research. In this paper, we propose a coexistence scheme for private LTE network in unlicensed spectrum that enables a fair spectrum sharing with co-located Wi-Fi networks. This is achieved by exploiting various LTE frame configurations consisting of different combinations of downlink, uplink, special subframe and muted subframes. The configuration of a single frame is decided based on a rule based algorithm that exploits Wi-Fi spectrum occupancy statistics that is obtained from a technology recognition system which is based on a Convolutional Neural Network. The performance of the proposed private LTE scheme and its coexistence with Wi-Fi is investigated for different traffic scenarios showcasing how the proposed scheme can lead to a harmless coexistence of LTE and Wi-Fi.","","978-1-7281-8695-5","10.1109/INFOCOMWKSHPS50562.2020.9162663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9162663","Private adaptive LTE;Wi-Fi;CNN;Technology Recognition;AI/ML;Fair Coexistence","Long Term Evolution;Wireless fidelity;3GPP;Synchronization;Wireless networks;Downlink","cellular radio;convolutional neural nets;Long Term Evolution;mobile computing;radio spectrum management;telecommunication network planning;wireless LAN","mobile network operator;reliable spectrum efficient services;unlicensed spectrum;coexistence scheme;private LTE network;co-located Wi-Fi networks;LTE frame configurations;Wi-Fi spectrum occupancy statistics;Convolutional Neural Network;adaptive CNN-based Private LTE solution;wireless network deployments;licensed radio spectrum;wireless communications;technology recognition system","","2","","19","","10 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the present paper, a device-free CSI based human identity identification approach using deep learning (Wihi) is proposed. Wihi mainly utilizes three key techniques to identify different people. Firstly, to eliminate the influence of the random noise, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) strategy is introduced to denoise raw CSI data by leveraging signal decomposition. Secondly, in order to characterize human's gaits profoundly, several representative features are exploited from different statistical profiles, including channel power distribution in time domain (CPD), time-frequency analysis (TFA), and energy distribution in different frequency bands (ED). Thirdly, a recurrent neural network (RNN) model with long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks is employed to learn the representative gait features extracted above and encode temporal information for realizing human identity identification. The proof-of-concept prototype of the proposed Wihi approach is implemented on a set of commercial WiFi devices, and multiple comprehensive experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of identity identification. The experimental results confirm that the proposed Wihi can achieve a satisfactory performance compared with some state-of-the-art approaches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3009123","Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Innovation Fund of Xidian University; Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671346); Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2020JM-180); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9139918","Human identity identification;commercial wifi devices;channel state information (CSI);recurrent neural network (RNN)","Wireless fidelity;Object recognition;Feature extraction;Fingerprint recognition;Indoor environments;Iris recognition;Recurrent neural networks","discrete wavelet transforms;gait analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;time-frequency analysis;wireless LAN","deep learning;channel state information;commercial WiFi devices;random noise;identification accuracies;device-free CSI;human identity identification approach;raw CSI data;channel power distribution;time-frequency analysis;Wihi approach","","6","","38","CCBY","14 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer of a deep machine learning network are two key parameters, which have main influence on the performance of the algorithm. Manual parameter setting and grid search approaches somewhat ease the users' tasks in setting these important parameters. Nonetheless, these two techniques can be very time-consuming. In this paper, we show that the Particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique holds great potential to optimize parameter settings and thus saves valuable computational resources during the tuning process of deep learning models. Specifically, we use a dataset collected from a Wi-Fi campus network to train deep learning models to predict the number of occupants and their locations. Our preliminary experiments indicate that PSO provides an efficient approach for tuning the optimal number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer of the deep learning algorithm when compared to the grid search method.

It is mainly because Wi-Fi networks are prevalent in the indoor environments these days; also it is more efficient than other methods as one can estimate his location by simply comparing current RSS (Received Signal Strength) with the fingerprint of Wi-Fi signals measured in advance at the area. One of the simple and popular approaches for matching an RSS with the Wi-Fi fingerprint, is known as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). While KNN uses all data stored in the fingerprint for the comparison, it shows relatively low accuracy due to the unstable nature of Wi-Fi signals: Especially in a spacious or congested place, its performance may severely degrade. In this paper, we adopt K-means clustering for an efficient and accurate classification in KNN. In our approach, in order to mitigate the effect of unstable Wi-Fi signals, the clustering is performed using every individual RSS values rather than representative mean values, which results in the elimination of extreme RSS values in the classification. In addition, locating the position by KNN utilizes the probability distribution of RSS values in each cluster. Under a wide range of K in KNN and the number of clusters, our experiments show notably enhanced performances than those of the classical KNN.","","978-1-5090-4032-2","10.1109/ICTC.2017.8190791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190791","indoor positioning;Wi-Fi fingerprint;Received Signal Strength (RSS);K-nearest neighbors (KNN);clustering;K-means","Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity;Maximum likelihood estimation;Current measurement;Clustering algorithms;Histograms;Algorithm design and analysis","indoor navigation;pattern clustering;radionavigation;RSSI;statistical distributions;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi fingerprint;KNN;unstable Wi-Fi signals;signal clustering;indoor positioning systems;Wi-Fi networks;indoor environments these days;probability distribution;K-means clustering;K-nearest neighbors;RSS;received signal strength","","9","","4","","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using Wi-Fi signal as an example, we demonstrate that the channel state information (CSI) obtained at the receiver contains rich information about the propagation environment. Through judicious preprocessing of the estimated CSI followed by deep learning, reliable presence detection can be achieved. Several challenges in passive RF sensing are addressed. With presence detection, how to collect training data with human presence can have a significant impact on the performance. This is in contrast to activity detection when a specific motion pattern is of interest. A second challenge is that RF signals are complex-valued. Handling complex-valued input in deep learning requires careful data representation and network architecture design. Finally, human presence affects CSI variation along multiple dimensions; such variation, however, is often masked by system impediments, such as timing or frequency offset. Addressing these challenges, the proposed learning system uses preprocessing to preserve human motion-induced channel variation while insulating against other impairments. A convolutional neural network (CNN) properly trained with both magnitude and phase information is then designed to achieve reliable presence detection. Extensive experiments are conducted. Using off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices, the proposed deep-learning-based RF sensing achieves near-perfect presence detection during multiple extended periods of test and exhibits superior performance compared with leading edge passive infrared sensors. A comparison with existing RF-based human presence detection also demonstrates its robustness in performance, especially when deployed in a completely new environment. The learning-based passive RF sensing thus provides a viable and promising alternative for presence or occupancy detection.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2020.3042908","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1730882); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9305220","Channel state information (CSI);convolutional neural networks (CNNs);multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM);presence detection;Wi-Fi sensing.","Sensors;Radio frequency;Wireless fidelity;OFDM;Receiving antennas;Time-frequency analysis;Feature extraction","","","","","","","IEEE","23 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The security challenges that need to be overcome mainly stem from the open nature of a wireless medium, such as a Wi-Fi network. An impersonation attack is an attack in which an adversary is disguised as a legitimate party in a system or communications protocol. The connected devices are pervasive, generating high-dimensional data on a large scale, which complicates simultaneous detections. Feature learning, however, can circumvent the potential problems that could be caused by the large-volume nature of network data. This paper thus proposes a novel deep-feature extraction and selection (D-FES), which combines stacked feature extraction and weighted feature selection. The stacked autoencoding is capable of providing representations that are more meaningful by reconstructing the relevant information from its raw inputs. We then combine this with modified weighted feature selection inspired by an existing shallow-structured machine learner. We finally demonstrate the ability of the condensed set of features to reduce the bias of a machine learner model as well as the computational complexity. Our experimental results on a well-referenced Wi-Fi network benchmark data set, namely, the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data set, prove the usefulness and the utility of the proposed D-FES by achieving a detection accuracy of 99.918% and a false alarm rate of 0.012%, which is the most accurate detection of impersonation attacks reported in the literature.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2017.2762828","Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion through the Korea Government (MSIT) (Research on Communication Technology using Bio-Inspired Algorithm and 2017-0-00555, Towards Provable-secure Multi-party Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol based on Lattices in a Quantum World)(grant numbers:2013-0-00396); National Research Foundation of Korea through the Korea Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:NRF-2015R1A-2A2A01006812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8067440","Intrusion detection system;impersonation attack;deep learning;feature extraction;stacked autoencoder;large-scale Wi-Fi networks","Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Support vector machines;Wireless networks;Computational modeling;Security;Machine learning","computer network security;feature extraction;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","simultaneous detections;feature learning;large-volume nature;deep-feature extraction;modified weighted feature selection;Wi-Fi network benchmark data;Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion data;detection accuracy;accurate detection;impersonation attack;Wi-Fi impersonation detection;mobile technologies;security challenges;wireless medium;high-dimensional data;shallow-structured machine learner","","94","","71","IEEE","13 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the performance of the IPS depending on a single access point (AP) can be much limited due to the multipath fading effect especially in most indoor environments involved with multiple non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation paths. In order to resolve this problem, in this paper, we propose a hybrid neural network that employs multiple APs to receive the CSI from. Each AP provides unique fingerprints to all the locations.

Experiments in a complex indoor environment with real values indicate that the proposed method reduces the positioning error compared to other methods, and is also comparable in terms of computational complexity.","","978-1-5386-4916-9","10.1109/ICEE.2018.8472473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8472473","Radio map;RSS;Wi-Fi fingerprint;KNN methodes;Indoor Positioning","Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity;Kalman filters;Electrical engineering;Mobile handsets;Mathematical model;Probabilistic logic","Global Positioning System;indoor navigation;indoor radio;Internet of Things;pattern clustering;wireless LAN","neighbors methods;Wi-Fi fingerprint;mobile device;Wi-Fi technology;offline phase;data collection;online phase;collected radio map;online positioning;Weighted Differential Coordinate Probabilistic-KNN method;WDCP-KNN;complex indoor environment;positioning error;Wi-Fi RSS indoor positioning system;online layer clustering;Nonintrusive SMS context;WinSMS;generalized Reference Points;differential coordinates;internet of things","","2","","18","","27 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The RSS- assisted cross-correlation (RACC) method can reduce noise and eliminate multipath interference to a certain extent, but too environmentally sensitive. Therefore, in this paper, an effective way of using the deep neural network is proposed to address this problem. Accordingly, the performance of the AutoEncoder in signal noise reduction and multipath interference elimination are discussed. To achieve better results, four AutoEncoder models are put forward, fully connection (FC), convolution plus fully connected (C-FC), convolution plus pooling (C-P), inception (ICP), and the performance of these four models are compared when processing signals with different signal to noise ratio (SNR) and multipath interference. The mean square error (MSE) and the time difference of arrival (TDoA) are the standards for evaluating the effect of signal noise reduction and multipath interference removal. Besides simulated data, we also conducted model performance comparisons in terms of ground truth signal. Experimental results show that fully connected layer is essential to automatic signal coding and the model performs better with the appropriate addition of convolution layer when faced with noise and multipath environments. Notably, compared with RACC method, the TDoA of two resultant signals obtained from the model is more accurate, verified by IEEE 802. 11b WLAN.","","978-1-7281-0286-3","10.1109/EDSSC.2019.8753922","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8753922","AutoEncoder;neural network;signal processing","","convolution;interference suppression;mean square error methods;multipath channels;neural nets;signal denoising;time-of-arrival estimation;wireless LAN","resultant signals;Wi-Fi Signal Noise Reduction;multipath elimination;cross-correlation method;multipath interference elimination;AutoEncoder models;convolution;multipath interference removal;model performance comparisons;ground truth signal;fully connected layer;automatic signal coding;multipath environments;signal to noise ratio","","","","3","","8 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The common received-signal-strength-based (RSS) fingerprinting presents performance degradation due to well-known signal fluctuations, but more recently, the more stable channel state information (CSI) has gained popularity. In this paper, we present SDR-Fi, the first reported Wi-Fi software-defined radio (SDR) receiver for indoor positioning using CSI measurements as features for deep learning (DL) classification. The CSI measurements are obtained from a fast-prototyping LabVIEW-based 802.11n SDR receiver platform. SDR-Fi measures CSI data passively from pilot beacon frames from a single access point (AP) at almost 10 Hz rate. A feed-forward neural network and a 1D convolutional neural network are examined to estimate location accuracy in representative testing scenarios for an indoor cluttered laboratory area, and an adjacent, covered outdoor area. The proposed DL classification methods leverage CSI-based fingerprinting for low AP scenarios, as opposed to traditional RSS-based systems, which require many APs for reliable positioning. Demonstration results are threefold: (a) A fast-prototyping SDR platform that passively extracts CSI measurements from Wi-Fi beacon frames, providing a genuine possibility for vendor network cards to provide such measurements, (b) two state-of-the-art DL classification methods outperforming traditional RSS-based methods for low AP scenarios, (c) a testing methodology for performance evaluation of the proposed indoor positioning system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2945929","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1719043); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8863907","Channel state information;deep learning;fingerprinting;indoor positioning;neural networks;software-defined radio","OFDM;IP networks;Fingerprint recognition;Channel estimation;Wireless fidelity;Receivers","convolutional neural nets;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);RSSI;software radio;telecommunication network reliability","received-signal-strength-based fingerprinting;Wi-Fi software-defined radio receiver;indoor positioning system;Wi-Fi beacon frames;fast-prototyping SDR platform;low AP scenarios;indoor cluttered laboratory area;1D convolutional neural network;feed-forward neural network;CSI data;LabVIEW-based 802.11n SDR receiver platform;deep learning classification;CSI measurements;stable channel state information;Wi-Fi fingerprinting-based indoor localization;SDR-Fi","","16","","48","CCBY","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The experiments in this paper evaluate the effect of real world Bluetooth and Wi-Fi signal interference on UAV detection and classification, using transfer learning via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extraction and machine learning classifiers Logistic Regression (LR) and k Nearest Neighbour (kNN). 2 class UAV detection, 4 class UAV type and 10 class flight mode classification are evaluated with graphical representation from the time and frequency domain. Flight modes evaluated included mode 1 - switched on and connected to the controller, mode 2 - hovering and mode 3 - flying. Results show that Bluetooth signals are more likely to interfere with detection and classification accuracy than Wi-Fi signals but that accuracy can be maintained at over 96% by using frequency domain features with LR as the classifier. Time domain features were shown to be less robust than frequency domain features when interefence signals were introduced. In the presence of Bluetooth or Wi-Fi signals, 2 class UAV detection produced 100% accuracy, 4 class UAV type classification produced 99.9% (+/- 0.1%) and 10 class UAV flight mode classification produced 96.4% (+/- 0.5%) accuracy.

State-of-the-art solutions mostly work on a single WiFi channel and hence are quite sensitive to the quality of a particular channel. Co-channel interference in an indoor environment can seriously undermine the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we for the first time explore wideband WiFi information with advanced deep learning toward more accurate and robust activity recognition. We present a practical Channel Selective Activity Recognition system (CSAR) with Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) WiFi devices. The key innovation is to actively select available WiFi channels with good quality and seamlessly hop among adjacent channels to form an extended channel. The wider bandwidth with more subcarriers offers stable information with a higher resolution for feature extraction. Conventional classification tools, e.g., hidden Markov model and k-nearest neighbors, however, are not only sensitive to feature distortion but also not smart enough to explore the time-scale correlations from the extracted spectrogram. We accordingly explore advanced deep learning tools for this application context. We demonstrate an integration of channel selection and long short term memory network (LSTM), which seamlessly combine the richer time and frequency features for activity recognition. We have implemented a CSAR prototype using Intel 5300 WiFi cards. Our real-world experiments show that CSAR achieves a stable recognition accuracy around 95 percent even in crowded wireless environments (compared to 80 percent with state-of-the-art solutions that highly depend on the quality of the working channel). We have also examined the impact of environments and persons, and the results reaffirm its robustness.","2327-4697","","10.1109/TNSE.2018.2825144","Canada Technology Demonstration Program; Canada NSERC Discovery Grant; NSERC E.W.R.

To this end, a range of communication technologies is available, such as cellular, vehicular WiFi or Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN); however, none of them can fully cover energy consumption and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.

AI(Artificial Intelligence), IoT(Internet of Things), and Big Data, which are major technologies of the 4th industry, can be effectively applied to these LBS technologies. In addition, in order to provide LBS technology to users in an indoor environment, the positioning results must be provided in real time. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a scheme for providing real-time user positioning results based on AI technology. The proposed scheme is based on Wi-Fi(Wireless Fidelity) communication, and applies DNN(Deep Neural Network), one of the AI technologies, for location positioning in the indoor office environment proposed by 3GPP(The 3rd Generation Partnership Project). In order to perform the user's location positioning, the DNN model learns the RSSI(Received Signal Strength Indicator) value of a specific location collected in the offline step and the corresponding location with one label. After that, in the online step, the location of the actual user is estimated based on the learned model. It can be seen that the proposed scheme achieves higher performance than the existing scheme in terms of processing time for performing positioning through simulation. This can be considered in order for the scheme to achieve real-time location positioning later.","","978-1-7281-7638-3","10.1109/ICAIIC51459.2021.9415207","Korea Institute for Advancement of Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9415207","LBS(Location Based Service);Indoor Positioning;PSO(Particle Swarm Optimization);DNN(Deep Neural Network);Wi-Fi(Wireless Fidelity)","Industries;Performance evaluation;Neural networks;Mobile communication;Real-time systems;Indoor environment;3GPP","3G mobile communication;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Global Positioning System;indoor radio;wireless LAN","3GPP indoor office environment;Internet of Things;Big Data;LBS technology;AI technology;3rd Generation Partnership Project;real-time location positioning;location based service technology;wireless fidelity communication;Wi-Fi communication;DNN based WiFi positioning model;deep neural network;3GPP;RSSI;received signal strength indicator;artificial intelligence;IoT","","","","8","","29 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm is popularly used in the localization system, due to its simplicity for implementation. However, traditional kNN algorithm might fail to consider the variability of correspondence between geometrical location and the similarity of received-signal-strength (RSS) vectors using Euclid distance. In the light of feature scaling kNN (FS-kNN) and continuous feature scaling kNN (CFS-kNN) algorithms, a novel indoor localization algorithm is proposed in this paper. The algorithm maps the similarity of each pair of RSS vectors to their geometrical distance without the ambiguous boundary that might yield in FS-kNN. To avoid the ambiguous boundary, the proposed algorithm determines the weights continuously by an artificial neural network (ANN) that can be trained via some samples. The conditions to guarantee the validity of this algorithm are discussed as well. The proposed algorithm can be used in eigher gridless or grid based RSS matching methods of indoor localization. In our experiment, the performance of the proposed algorithm is better than RADAR, FS-kNN and CFS-kNN, in term of accuracy. Moreover, ANN is more flexible and reasonable than other fixed structure schemes to determine the weights used in the feature-scaling based algorithms. The algorithm is easy to realize in engineering as well.","2157-1481","978-1-6654-3892-6","10.1109/ICMTMA52658.2021.00064","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409997","Indoor Localization;RSS;Feature-scaling;Artificial neural net-work;Wi-Fi","Location awareness;Radio frequency;Mechatronics;Automation;Artificial neural networks;Radar;Fingerprint recognition","indoor navigation;indoor radio;nearest neighbour methods;neural nets;radionavigation;telecommunication computing","CFS-kNN;feature-scaling based algorithms;Radio Frequency fingerprint based localization system;received-signal-strength vectors;continuous feature scaling kNN algorithms;indoor localization algorithm;RSS vectors;geometrical distance;ANN feature scaling;k-nearest neighbor algorithm;grid based RSS matching methods;gridless RSS matching methods;Euclid distance","","","","12","","23 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Human beings have unique body structures and gaits patterns, so they induce different signal propagation paths which results in producing unique CSI signatures. These unique CSI signatures could be mapped with each individual person portraying them and by thus uniquely identifying a person. Since there are limited empirical research conducted on human identification using Wi-Fi and deep learning models, we propose a Deep bidirectional LSTM recurrent Neural networks (DBD-LSTM-RNN) for Identifying humans indoors using channel state information. A deep bidirectional LSTM-RNN model that segments the signals to determine the start and the end of human gait and map them with the appropriate body structure is deployed. Furthermore, we employed the Chebyshev filter to reduce noise on the collected CSI data. Lastly, the model is tested and evaluated using the data we have collected.

However, studies examining micro-Doppler classification using passive WiFi radar have relied on manually stimulating WiFi access points to increase the bandwidths and duty-cycles of transmissions; either through file-downloads to generate high data-rate signals, or increasing the repetition frequency of the WiFi beacon signal from its default setting. In real-world scenarios, both these approaches would require user access to the WiFi network or WiFi access point through password authentication, and therefore involve a level of cooperation which cannot always be relied upon e.g. in law-enforcement applications. In this research, we investigate WiFi activity classification using just WiFi probe response signals which can be generated using a low-cost off-the-shelf secondary device (Raspberry Pi) eliminating the requirement to actually connect to the WiFi network. This removes the need to have continuous data traffic in the network or to modify the firmware configuration to manipulate the beacon signal interval, making the technology deployable in all situations. An activity recognition model based on a convolutional neural network resulted in an overall classification accuracy of 75% when trained from scratch using 300 measured WiFi probe-response samples across 6 classes. This value is then increased to 82%, with significantly less training when adopting a transfer learning approach: initial training using WiFi data traffic signals, followed by fine-tuning using probe response signals.","2375-5318","978-1-7281-1679-2","10.1109/RADAR.2019.8835660","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8835660","Activity Recognition;Passive WiFi Doppler Radar;Probe Response;Transfer Learning","Wireless fidelity;Probes;Doppler effect;Passive radar;Activity recognition;Doppler radar","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);passive radar;radar target recognition;radar tracking;wireless LAN","passive activity classification;WiFi probe response signals;Raspberry Pi signal generation;WiFi network connection independent;firmware configuration;activity recognition model;convolutional neural network;transfer learning approach;WiFi data traffic signals","","1","","21","","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, a smartphone always needs to be connected to Internet. In this paper, we introduce a stand-alone earthquake detection device equipped with an acceleration sensor and Wi-Fi, First, we systematically evaluated a set of acceleration sensors by assessing their performance and accuracy to select the most suitable acceleration sensor, and then developed an designated device that can detect earthquakes and send alerts to nearby devices.

These encrypted connections from user handsets are seen as potential security threats in enterprise networks. In this paper, we develop a machine learning-based system for monitoring encrypted traffic of IPSec tunnels on the network to distinguish Wi-Fi calling traffic from anomalies. Our contributions are as follows: (1) We analyze traffic traces consisting of carrier Wi-Fi calls made over four mobile networks to highlight network behavioral characteristics of this enterprise application. We develop a set of models using one-class and multi-class classification algorithms to determine if Wi-Fi calling application is present on the IPSec tunnel (if so, to classify its state), otherwise generate a notification to block the non Wi-Fi calling flow, and (2) We evaluate the efficacy of our system in detecting real calls and their states (initiation, heartbeat, and actual call) as well as raising true alarms in case of anomalous traffic.","0742-1303","978-1-7281-1028-8","10.1109/LCN44214.2019.8990802","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8990802","","","business communication;computer network security;cryptography;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","enterprise campuses;poor signal coverage indoors;mobile operators;carrier Wi-Fi calling services;mobile phone calls;enterprise Wi-Fi connection;mobile carriers;IPSec tunnel;traverse untrusted enterprise networks;public Internet;encrypted connections;user handsets;security threats;machine learning-based system;encrypted traffic;mobile networks;enterprise application;nonWi-Fi calling flow;anomalous traffic;Wi-Fi calling traffic monitoring;network behavioral characteristics;one-class classification;multiclass classification","","","","13","","13 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A major problem is the variation of signal distributions caused by multiple factors, which makes the old localization model inaccurate. Therefore, the transfer learning problem in a WILS aims to transfer the knowledge from an old model to a new one. In this paper, we study the characteristics of signal variation and conclude the chief factors as time and devices. An algorithm LuMA is proposed to handle the transfer learning problem caused by these two factors. LuMA is a dimensionality reduction method, which learns a mapping between a source data set and a target data set in a low-dimensional space. Then the knowledge can be transferred from source data to target data using the mapping relationship. We implement a WILS in our wireless environment and apply LuMA on it. The on-line performanceevaluation shows that our algorithm not only achieves better accuracy than the baselines, but also has ability for adaptive localization, regardless of time or device factors. As a result, the calibration efforts on new training data can be greatly reduced.","","978-0-7695-3495-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2008.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4724994","Transfer leanring;dimension reduction;Wi-Fi localization","Machine learning;Fingerprint recognition;Training data;Humans;Signal detection;Sun;Computers;Mobile computing;Calibration;Radar","Global Positioning System;software performance evaluation;wireless LAN","adaptive localization;transfer learning;indoor Wi-Fi environment;signal distributions;transfer learning problem;dimensionality reduction method","","45","1","13","","22 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, current works are mostly designed for single human environment owing to the complexity of multiple human environments, the limited bandwidth of Wi-Fi and in turn, greatly hinder this technology from the real implementation. To realize such device-free sensing in multiple human environments, the first step-stone is to estimate how many targets or in other words crowd counting in a closed environment, which is not only the basis for multiple human environmental sensing but also leads to many potential applications such as crowd control. To this end, we propose DeepCount—a solution using deep learning approach to infer the number of people in an indoor environment with Wi-Fi signals. Our scheme is based on the key intuition that, although with great complexity, the deep learning approaches can somehow be able to build a complex function to fit the correlation between the number of people and channel state information values. Furthermore, to alleviate the inadequate amount of data required and improve the adaptability of the deep learning approach, we add an online transfer learning approach, which utilizes the entering/leaving results to fine-tune the deep learning model. The prototype of Deep-Count is implemented and evaluated on the commercial Wi-Fi device. By the massive training samples, our deep learning model is able to estimate the number of crowd up to 5 with the mean accuracy of 82.3% by this end-to-end learning approach. Meanwhile, by using the amendment mechanism of the activity recognition model to judge door switch to get the variance of the crowd to amend deep learning predicted results, the accuracy is up to 87% in a rather effective manner.","2509-3312","","10.23919/JCIN.2019.8917884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8917884","crowd counting;Wi-Fi signals;neural network;human activity recognition","Wireless fidelity;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Activity recognition;Training;Neural networks","","","","2","","","","6 Feb 2020","","","PTP","PTP Journals"

Besides the utilization of up-to-date sensing techniques, modern activity recognition systems also require a machine learning (ML) algorithm that leverages the sensory data for identification purposes. In view of the unique characteristics of the measurement data and the ML challenges thereof, we propose a non-intrusive human activity recognition system that only uses existing commodity WiFi routers. The core of our system is a novel multiple kernel representation learning (MKRL) framework that automatically extracts and combines informative patterns from the Channel State Information (CSI) measurements. The MKRL firstly learns a kernel string representation from time, frequency, wavelet, and shape domains with an efficient greedy algorithm. Then it performs information fusion from diverse perspectives based on multi-view kernel learning. Moreover, different stages of MKRL can be seamlessly integrated into a multiple kernel learning framework to build up a robust and comprehensive activity classifier. Extensive experiments are conducted in typical indoor environments and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms existing methods and achieves a 98\% activity recognition accuracy.","","978-1-5386-1418-1","10.1109/ICMLA.2017.0-148","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8260644","Multiple Kernel Learning;Representation Learning;Human Activity Recognition;WiFi CSI Data Mining","Wireless fidelity;Activity recognition;Kernel;Tools;Frequency-domain analysis;Feature extraction;OFDM","greedy algorithms;image recognition;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor fusion;wireless LAN","MKRL;robust activity classifier;comprehensive activity classifier;multiple kernel representation learning;machine learning algorithm;ML;sensory data;measurement data;nonintrusive human activity recognition system;Channel State Information measurements;kernel string representation;WiFi routers;CSI measurements;greedy algorithm","","7","","22","","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We develop neural network based solutions for two positioning approaches, modelling Dead Reckoning with recurrent neural networks and WiFi Fingerprinting with deep neural networks. We propose a multimodal deep neural network architecture (MM-Loc) that bridges the features extracted by the modality-specific complements (sensor based and WiFi based) to join the two perspectives.

It tries to find the most likely position using processed features in a radio map. This paper compares the performance of two machine learning tools, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), in exploiting the multipath information for Indoor localization problem. The investigation was carried out in a noisy indoor scenario, where Non-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) between target and sensors may affect the location of Wi-Fi Access point strongly. It is possible to improve the position system performance by using fingerprints techniques that employ multipath information in a Machine Learning framework, which operates a dataset generated by real time. Usually, real measurements produce the fingerprints localization features, and there is mismatching with the simulated data. Another drawback of NLOS features extraction is the noise level that occurs in position processing. Random Forest algorithm uses fully grown decision trees to classify possible emitter position, trying to achieve error mitigation by reducing variance. On the other hand, XGBoost approach uses weak learners, defined by high bias and low variance. The results of the simulation show that XGBoost reaches a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 1.77m while RF has 1.83m, as shown in Fig. (4). In real time analysis, 40 points were used for testing. RF has an MSE 1.85m and XGBoost has 1.82m.

Existing solutions are either not practical or have limited accuracy. We propose two novel solutions to mitigate device heterogeneity for representative localization approaches using Gaussian Process regression and neural network, respectively. The first solution is built upon Gaussian Process regression by jointly calibrating and localizing a target device. The second solution utilizes adversarial training with neural network.

Inspired by the word2vec embedding technique used for the next word prediction, we present a new method called loc2vec in which each location is encoded as a vector whereby the more often two locations cooccur in the location sequences, the closer their vectors will be. Using the vector representation, we divide long mobility sequences into several sub-sequences and use them to form Mobility Subsequence Matrices on which we run CNN classification which will be used later for the prediction. We run extensive testing and experimentation on a subset of a large real mobility trace database made publicly available through the CRAWDAD project. Our results show that loc2vec embedding and CNN-based prediction provide significant improvement in the next location prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Intuitively, discovering a good feature representation across domains is crucial. In this paper, we first propose to find such a representation through a new learning method, transfer component analysis (TCA), for domain adaptation. TCA tries to learn some transfer components across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space using maximum mean miscrepancy. In the subspace spanned by these transfer components, data properties are preserved and data distributions in different domains are close to each other. As a result, with the new representations in this subspace, we can apply standard machine learning methods to train classifiers or regression models in the source domain for use in the target domain. Furthermore, in order to uncover the knowledge hidden in the relations between the data labels from the source and target domains, we extend TCA in a semisupervised learning setting, which encodes label information into transfer components learning. We call this extension semisupervised TCA. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a novel dimensionality reduction framework for reducing the distance between domains in a latent space for domain adaptation. We propose both unsupervised and semisupervised feature extraction approaches, which can dramatically reduce the distance between domain distributions by projecting data onto the learned transfer components. Finally, our approach can handle large datasets and naturally lead to out-of-sample generalization. The effectiveness and efficiency of our approach are verified by experiments on five toy datasets and two real-world applications: cross-domain indoor WiFi localization and cross-domain text classification.","1941-0093","","10.1109/TNN.2010.2091281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5640675","Dimensionality reduction;domain adaptation;Hilbert space embedding of distributions;transfer learning","Kernel;Optimization;Manifolds;Hilbert space;Learning systems;Feature extraction;Noise measurement","Hilbert spaces;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;regression analysis;text analysis;wireless LAN","domain adaptation;transfer component analysis;learning method;kernel Hilbert space;maximum mean miscrepancy;standard machine learning methods;classifiers;regression models;semisupervised learning;dimensionality reduction framework;semisupervised feature extraction approach;cross-domain indoor WiFi localization;cross-domain text classification","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Automatic Data Processing;Computer Simulation;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Transfer (Psychology)","1827","6","37","IEEE","18 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Various localization mechanisms have been developed, including outdoor satellite navigation system and indoor received signal strength (RSS) based on WiFi and BLE Beacon. However, they can only localize the target while being equipped with a receiver. Instead, passive indoor localization is the device-free technique that can localize a target without carrying any electronic devices in a selected region. In this paper, a scheme for operating passive indoor localization is proposed. In the scheme, the location images are constructed by utilizing channel state information (CSI) while the localization model is built and trained by using deep learning. With the help of convolutional neural networks (CNN), this scheme only requires original CSI amplitude instead of manual extraction of features. We demonstrate the accuracy of this scheme in two typical indoor scenarios. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves an accuracy of more than an average of 94% and 96% respectively in the scenario of the office and the corridory.","","978-1-5386-3755-5","10.1109/UPINLBS.2018.8559775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8559775","indoor localization;device-free;channel state information;convolutional neural networks","Location awareness;Transmitters;Receivers;Manuals;Feature extraction;Satellite navigation systems;Stability analysis","feedforward neural nets;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;RSSI;satellite navigation;wireless LAN","passive indoor localization;convolutional neural networks;location-based services;localization mechanisms;outdoor satellite navigation system;indoor received signal strength;channel state information;CSI;CNN;RSS;security systems;WiFi;BLE beacon;deep learning","","13","","18","","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem with fingerprinting approach is the high variation of RSSI values, resulting in erroneous location estimation. Machine learning approach is a new alternative to fingerprinting approach that aims to solve this problem. In this study, we adopt grid-based approach to train the Random Forest models with an end-to-end pipleline to autotune the models hyperparameter. In addition, we explore the impact of features by studying the default RSSI values for undetected AP as well as the feature importance. It highlights the significance of selecting the data pre-processing and the AP's RSSI combinations. RSSI data are collected from WiFi access points (APs) as WiFi access points are widely available and are at fixed location, which does not requires specific hardware support. The evaluation are benchmarked against the self-collected data in the university, called N4, and the publicly available dataset UJIndoorLoc (UJI). The results show that random forest classifier is the overall best performance for classification-based indoor localization, with up to 88.21% and 86.34% for N4 and UJI dataset respectively. By eliminating unimportant APs, the accuracy is maintained at 80% accuracy with 20% of features using PCA. It has shown that our proposed pipeline/framework provides a resilient constructed model in localizing the grid-base location when some of the APs are not detected.","","978-1-7281-8376-3","10.1109/IDSTA50958.2020.9263706","Nanyang Technological University (NTU); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9263706","Wi-Fi Indoor Localisation;Random Forest;Machine Learning;Feature Selection;Principle Component Analysis","Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Buildings;Floors;Training;Random forests;Data collection","indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);RSSI;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","feature engineering;grid-based multifloor indoor localisation;health care;accurate indoor location;fingerprinting approach;location estimation;machine learning approach;random forest models;end-to-end pipleline;feature importance;RSSI data;WiFi access points;publicly available dataset UJIndoorLoc;random forest classifier;classification-based indoor localization;resilient constructed model;grid-base location","","","","26","","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the potential sequential correlations among the subcarriers and consecutive CSI packets are yet to be exploited in those networks. In this study, we propose a two-level nested long short-term memory (LSTM) network named IPRIC to recognize the indoor positions and classify the type of interferences of Wi-Fi CSI data by analyzing the sequential correlations among the subcarriers and consecutive packets.

As a well-established approach, contact tracing could contain epidemic diseases spread. Since WiFi network could cover almost the whole campus and each student carries at least one WiFi capable device (i.e., smartphone), in this work, an epidemic contact tracing with campus WiFi network and smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is proposed, involving not only coarse-grained duration, but also fine-grained distance between students. First, students' location distribution and duration are captured by non-perception WiFi network logs with highly flexibility. Then, the convolutional neural network (CNN) model is utilized to real-time recognize landmarks in PDR positioning trajectory, followed by the particle filter algorithm to fuse both the PDR positioning results and detected landmarks, thereby calibrating PDR cumulative error and calculating the social distance between students. Next, we analyze the contact degree between students by integrating duration and social distance.

To ensure a fair coexistence of LAA in the unlicensed spectrum with other technologies, e.g., with Wi-Fi, 3GPP has standardized the use of Listen Before Talk (LBT) as the default channel-access scheme for LAA. However, the performance of Wi-Fi when coexisting with LAA mainly relies on how the LBT parameters are configured by the LAA. In this paper, we focus on the Contention Window (CW) size parameter of LBT in LAA. We propose a Neural Network (NN) based scheme that adapts the CW size based on the predicted number of Negative Acknowledgments (NACKs) for all the subframes in a Transmit Opportunity (TXOP) of LAA. In particular, our proposed scheme learns from the past experience how many NACKs per subframe of a TXOP were received under certain channel conditions. The performance evaluation shows that our proposed scheme, when compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, provides the best trade-off between the fairness to Wi-Fi and the LAA performance in terms of both throughput and latency.","2166-9589","978-1-5386-3531-5","10.1109/PIMRC.2017.8292751","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8292751","LAA;HARQ;Machine Learning;Wi-Fi;Unlicensed Spectrum;ns-3;LBT;R language;Coexistence","Wireless fidelity;3GPP;Long Term Evolution;Sensors;Protocols;Delays","learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;wireless LAN","Neural Network;Wi-Fi;3GPP;LTE-LAA;contention window size adaptation;frequency 5.0 GHz","","15","","18","","15 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

That is to say, we learn to predict the channel state on a given link through measurements on other links, thus decreasing signaling overhead. In particular, we model the problem as a link-prediction one and we consider two representative approaches: Random Dot Product Graphs and Graph Neural Networks. The key point is that these methods consider the geometric structure underlying the data.

Deep learning models have been utilized to distinguish the benign and malicious traffic. However, projecting the tabular data into images before the image classification has been the main challenge of leveraging deep learning for IDS purposes.We propose the novel projection of tabular data into 2-coded color mapping for IDS purposes. The proposed method employs a feature selection method to ensure optimal dimensionality. We examined the different number of attribute subsets to obtain the relationship between the attributes. Furthermore, it takes advantage of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the Wi-Fi attacks. We evaluate the proposed model using the most commonWi-Fi attacks dataset, AegeanWi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID2). The proposed method achieved an F1 score of 99.73% and a false positive rate of 0.24%. This study highlights the importance of addressing the mapping procedures from tabular data into grid-based data before deep learning training and validates the effectiveness of CNN to detect multiple types of wireless network attacks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3164104","Universitas Indonesia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745910","wireless attacks;intrusion detection system;convolutional neural network;anomaly detection","Residual neural networks;Deep learning;Convolutional neural networks;Wireless networks;Wireless fidelity;Feature extraction;Image color analysis","","","","","","","CCBY","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In Deauth-DoS attack an attacker sends a large number of spoofed de-authentication frames to the client (s) resulting in their disconnection. Existing solutions to mitigate Deauth-DoS attack rely on encryption, protocol modifications, 802.11 standard up gradation, software and hardware upgrades which are costly. In this paper we propose a Machine Learning (ML) based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect the Deauth-DoS attack in Wi-Fi network which does not suffer from these drawbacks. To the best of our knowledge ML based techniques have never been used for detection of Deauth-DoS attack. We have used a variety of ML based classifiers for detection of Deauth-DoS attack enabling an administrator to choose among a host of classification algorithms. Experiments performed on in-house test bed shows that the proposed ML based IDS detects Deauth-DoS attack with precision (accuracy) and recall (detection rate) exceeding 96% mark.","","978-1-4799-8697-2","10.1109/SMC.2015.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7379187","Deauthentication DoS;Wi-Fi Security;Intrusion Detection System","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Computer crime;Encryption;Authentication;Protocols;Software","computer network security;cryptographic protocols;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;wireless LAN","deauthentication DoS attack detection;machine learning approach;media access layer vulnerability;MAC vulnerability;IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi network;denial of service;Deauth-DoS attack;encryption;protocol modification;intrusion detection system;IDS;ML based classifier","","13","","13","","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An optimal rotation and segmentation algorithm is proposed to segment the spectrogram of a continuous flow into the subspectrograms of its subflows. The number of people in each subflow is estimated from its subspectrogram via convolutional neural networks, which add up to the total people count in the continuous flow.

However, there are many challenges to the heterogeneous network which is mainly formed by LTE-U and Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) in the 5GHz unlicensed band. For improving the utilization of the unlicensed band, spectrum sharing of cognitive radio (CR) is an effective solution. For CR users (CRs) which have no information about primary users (PUs), the detected signal may be LTE or Wi-Fi signal, and how to accurately recognize both will be a challenge. In this paper, a blind recognition method of signals is proposed in LTE-U and Wi-Fi heterogeneous cognitive networks, and the signal model based on third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) LTE and 802.11 Wi-Fi is considered. Without any prior information, the proposed method is based on the signal characteristic parameters which include the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) size, oversampling ratio and the number of effective subcarriers and these parameters are estimated based on autocorrelation and high order spectrum (HOS) properties of the signal. The blind recognition performance of the LTE and Wi-Fi signals is simulated versus different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, simulation results show that the proposed method not only has better recognition performance, but also has lower complexity than the method based on eighth order statics and neural network classifier (EOS-NN).","","978-1-5386-4502-4","10.1109/ICCChina.2017.8330417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8330417","LTE-U and Wi-Fi heterogeneous cognitive networks;signal blind recognition;FFT size;oversampling ratio;effective subcarriers;autocorrelation;high order spectrum","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;OFDM;Correlation;Interference;Fading channels;Estimation","3G mobile communication;blind source separation;cellular radio;cognitive radio;fast Fourier transforms;Long Term Evolution;neural nets;radio spectrum management;signal classification;signal detection;signal sampling;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi heterogeneous cognitive network;cellular network capacity;Long Term Evolution;heterogeneous network;LTE-U;spectrum sharing;cognitive radio;Wi-Fi signal;blind recognition method;neural network classifier;third generation generation partnership project LTE;frequency 5.0 GHz","","","","14","","5 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By exploiting the frequency selective behaviour of CSI with a cubic SVM classifier, we count the number of people in an elevator with an accuracy of 92%, and count the occupancy of an office to 97%. As opposed to using a multi-class counting approach, this paper aggregates CSI for the occupancies below and above a COVID-Safe limit. We show that this binary classification approach to the COVID safe decision problem has similar or better accuracy outcomes with much lower computational complexity, allowing for real-world implementation on IoT embedded devices.

As RFF leverages the discriminable hardware imperfections reflected in Radio Frequency (RF) signals for device identification, it has a good property of scalability, accuracy, energy-efficiency and tamper resistance. However, its identification accuracy might be compromised when the locations of training and testing are different, which is a more realistic assumption in practical scenarios. To address this issue, we study the location-invariant RFF feature extraction and identification method for WiFi Network Interface Cards (NICs). Firstly, we present an RFF feature extraction approach named Differential Phase of Pilots (DPoP). To further address the low-dimensional feature space problem, we propose another novel RFF extraction approach named Amplitude of Quotient (AoQ). AoQ exploits the fact that the RFFs of two Long Training Sequences (LTSs) in WiFi frames exhibit semi-steady characteristics and two LTSs in the same frame have similar channel frequency responses. Next, we use Euclidean distance and Deep Neural Network (DNN) for AoQ authentication and identification, respectively. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed AoQ method among 55 WiFi NICs of 5 models.

These techniques have been primarily investigated for ultra-wide band (UWB) systems, but little attention has been paid to WiFi systems, which are far more prevalent in practice. In this study, we address the NLOS identification and mitigation problems using multiple received signal strength (RSS) measurements from WiFi signals. Key to our approach is exploiting several statistical features of the RSS time series, which are shown to be particularly effective. We develop and compare two algorithms based on machine learning and a third based on hypothesis testing to separate LOS/NLOS measurements. Extensive experiments in various indoor environments show that our techniques can distinguish between LOS/NLOS conditions with an accuracy of around 95%. Furthermore, the presented techniques improve distance estimation accuracy by 60% as compared to state-of-the-art NLOS mitigation techniques. Finally, improvements in distance estimation accuracy of 50% are achieved even without environment-specific training data, demonstrating the practicality of our approach to real world implementations.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2014.2372341","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/L00416X/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6963485","NLOS identification and mitigation;machine learning;hypothesis testing;localization;NLOS identification and mitigation;machine learning;hypothesis testing;localization","Testing;Feature extraction;Training;Accuracy;Wireless communication;Training data;Machine learning algorithms","indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);RSSI;time series;ultra wideband communication;wireless LAN","NLOS identification technique;nonline-of-sight identification technique;ultra wideband system;UWB system;Wi-Fi system;multiple RSS measurement;received signal strength;machine learning;LOS measurement;indoor environment;RSS time series statistical features","","125","","47","IEEE","20 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The key intuition is that different handwriting movements induce different multi-path distortions in WiFi signals and generate distinct patterns in the time-series of Channel State Information (CSI). In this paper, a proposed WiFi-based system namely Wima, by means of which, we are in pursuit of an advanced solution to recognize letters written by hand in the air. Unlike existing WiFi-based handwriting recognition systems, Wima extracts features directly from the original CSI and then transmit them to subsequent classifiers immediately, a deep-learning-based method is firstly introduced in our system to automatically extract high-level features. More specifically, Wima transforms CSI characters like amplitude and phase into images, which are afterwards delivered to extract features by adopting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) respectively. The final simulation with commercial IEEE 802.11n NICs shows that Wima can achieve air-writing recognition with a better performance when compared with some existing routine approaches.","","978-1-7281-8275-9","10.1109/BigCom51056.2020.00008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9160465","WiFi Signals;Air-writing Recognition;CSI Image;Convolutional Neural Networks","Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Handwriting recognition;Phase measurement;Writing;Data mining;Hidden Markov models","convolutional neural nets;handwriting recognition;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless LAN","air-writing recognition;deep learning;WiFi signals;device-free handwriting recognition;Human-Computer Interaction;physical devices;key intuition;handwriting movements;multipath distortions;distinct patterns;time-series;Channel State Information;WiFi-based system;Wima;high-level features;CSI characters;WiFi-based handwriting recognition systems","","3","","35","","6 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional user authentication methods include Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) and biometric technology. However, the PINs are easily leaked to others, and biometric technology requires specialized equipment. Different from traditional user authentication methods, in this paper, we use widely deployed WiFi infrastructure to achieve user authentication, and propose WiPass, which is a PIN-free and device-free user authentication leveraging behavioral features via WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). The key idea is to explore personalized behavioral information captured by WiFi CSI to identify different users. Concretely, we first proposed a data visualization method to visualize CSI data as a set of time-series images to preserve the behavior information of keystrokes. Secondly, all these images jointly input into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature learning, and the obtained 256-dimensional deep behavior features are used to learn a linear support vector machine classifier. To demonstrate the effectiveness of WiPass, we built a prototype of WiPass on low-cost commodity WiFi devices and verified its performance in three different real environments. The empirical results show that WiPass achieved an average of 90.5% authentication accuracy, 7.5% false acceptance rate, and 6% false rejection rate for 11 participants in three real environments.","","978-1-6654-1868-3","10.1109/CTISC52352.2021.00030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527666","component;Channel State Information;Behavioral features;User authentication;Convolutional Neural Network","Support vector machines;Performance evaluation;Biometrics (access control);Authentication;Data visualization;Prototypes;Pins","authorisation;convolutional neural nets;data visualisation;deep learning (artificial intelligence);human computer interaction;message authentication;pattern classification;support vector machines;wireless LAN","WiPass;device-free user authentication;WiFi channel state information;personalized behavioral information;WiFi CSI;256-dimensional deep behavior features;PIN-free user authentication;convolutional neural network;Personal Identification Numbers;linear support vector machine classifier;feature learning;human-computer interaction;data visualization","","","","14","","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our machine learning strategy involves extracting 31 features from the WiFi signal and the UAV VS, which are then input to the classifier. Among the 31 features, 30 are statistical in the time and frequency domain, while the remaining one involves the effective subcarrier feature. We evaluate four different machine learning (ML) classifier variants and demonstrate through simulation and experiments that the proposed method can accurately recognize UAV VS in the presence of WiFi interference.

Although the fingerprinting data can be easily collected by portable mobile devices, to achieve robust and efficient indoor localization remains challenging with two constraints. First, the localization accuracy will be degraded by the random fluctuation of signals that caused by multipath effects from RSS signals. Second, indoor localization algorithms are time-consuming due to the handcrafting features and complex filtering on raw dataset. To achieve high localization accuracy with WiFi fingerprinting, in this paper, we propose CapsLoc, a robust indoor localization system by using capsule networks. Specifically, the capsule network model can efficiently extract hierarchical structures from WiFi fingerprint with three main components, including a convolutional layer, a primary capsule layer and a feature capsule layer. We conduct a real-world experimental field test with over 33600 data points.

Many proposed techniques for detecting toxic comments use deep neural networks. Like Siri, a smartwatch can use a remote service to detect toxic comments, or alternatively run the neural network on the edge to detect such comments. This paper presents the results of an experiment comparing the tradeoffs in memory consumption, CPU load and response time between running a toxic text detection CNN on a Samsung S3 smartwatch, or running the CNN remotely using computational offloading. Sentences were processed either periodically or by using a Poisson distribution with periods of between 0.25 and 4 minutes. The results were that there was little difference in battery depletion between running the CNN locally on the watch or remotely running the CNN. However, using WIFI for offloading resulted in much better (<; 1 second) response time than running the CNN on the watch (1-2 seconds).

However, because of the interference of multi-path effects, the received signal strength data (RSS) are quite possibly to have fluctuated, thus they may result in propagation errors into localization results. In order to tackle this issue, We propose refined fingerprints based bidirectional long-short-term memory (bi-LSTM) neural network to learn the key features from the tested coarse RSS data, obtaining extracted trained weights as refined fingerprints(RFs). The extracted features of refined fingerprints are capable to demonstrate strong robustness with fluctuated signals and represent the environmental properties. The effectiveness of our bi-LSTM network is substantiated in the complex indoor environment, and accuracy is remarkably improved compared with our previous algorithm and other RSS-based approaches.","2573-3311","978-1-6654-1254-4","10.1109/ICACI52617.2021.9435876","Aeronautical Science Foundation of China; Shanghai Rising-Star Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9435876","Long-short-term memory;bidirectional-LSTM;indoor localization;refined fingerprints;neural networks","Location awareness;Learning systems;Neural networks;Training data;Fingerprint recognition;Tools;Feature extraction","feature extraction;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;telecommunication computing","indoor localization;bidirectional LSTM networks;flourishing development;location based service;indoor environments;access points;industry popularization;WiFi fingerprints;multipath effects;received signal strength data;long-short-term memory;neural network;biLSTM network;complex indoor environment;RSS-based approaches;coarse RSS data testing;RF","","","","30","","25 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To see static objects in this arena, this research introduces Wi-Fi static object imaging and classification with low cost. It will allow detection of dangerous chest mounted explosives or weapons on buses and subways where expensive detection systems are not desired. However, this involves many challenges. The images created will be barely identifiable due to the low resolution of Wi-Fi, but the images need to be classified (identified). There are two major portions to this research. The first is the signal processing portion, where images are created, and the second is the image classification portion. In the signal processing portion, images will be created by using Wi-Fi signals transmitted and received on Ettus Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) hardware and directional antennas. These USRP's are interfaced to GNU Radio for which the researchers have developed specialized routines to implement this portion of the research. In the image classification phase, the images created are very blob-like with different reflective intensities. These images need some form of intelligence to classify them, and the system needs to improve its classification over time. AI neural networks are employed and developed to work on the images.

A novel Sensing-Fi system described in this paper aims to overcome such deficiencies. The system design is comprised of harnessing Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) coupled with ground-mounted accelerometer to detect floor vibration, hence the system is completely passive and non-invasive, i.e., the user is not required to wear the technology contrary to wearable accelerometers. In addition, contrary to the existing standalone Wi-Fi CSI fall detection systems, it overcomes the constraint by which only one user can be present in the room.

Adaptive filtering is performed to make the surveillance signal source-data invariant by eliminating the echoes of the direct transmitted signal.

To achieve full WiFi coverage in a wide area is costly due to the large-scale AP deployment spending and considerable operating expenditure. However, with limited literature available, how to deploy and manage those APs in an efficient and economical way, is still unknown for system providers. To bridge this gap, in this article, we first collect large-scale AP usage data in our campus WiFi system, which contains over 8000 APs and serves more than 40 000 active end-users in the area of 3.0925 km<sup>2</sup>. After mining large-scale spatio-temporal user associations, we obtain several key insights as follows. First, Idle Phenomenon prevails throughout the trace, in which large portion of APs are wasted without any user association. Second, AP usages in different buildings have very distinct characteristics in terms of user association and traffic consumption. Third, diurnal usage patterns are very obvious not only at singe AP level but also at the building and the whole system level. Many deployment and management strategies can benefit from these insights, e.g., heterogeneous AP deployment and intelligent AP management. Among them, we then propose an intelligent large-scale AP management scheme, called LAM, to dynamically control large-scale APs (ON or OFF) for energy saving and meanwhile without loss of WiFi coverage. In LAM, based on history association records, the user load of each AP is predicted by machine learning algorithms, and those APs whose idle durations are longer than the length of the predefined time window, will be switched off during the duration. We conduct extensive trace-driven experiments to demonstrate its efficacy; on average, more than 70% of power consumption can be markedly saved with over 92% of WiFi coverage guaranteed, which is able to save empirical $59 000 per year just for our system.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2933266","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1736207); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61572324); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8789648","Big data and machine learning;full WiFi coverage;large-scale AP deployment and management;large-scale AP power saving;spatio-temporal user association","Wireless fidelity;Buildings;Switches;Network topology;Machine learning algorithms","computer network management;data mining;intelligent networks;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","spatio-temporal association analytics;large-scale spatio-temporal user associations;WiFi system;large-scale AP management scheme;intelligent AP management","","10","","30","IEEE","6 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper proposes a metric to quantify the Quality of Experience (QoE) impact of side-channel interference based on passive, granular wireless driver parameter samples from consumer grade WiFi Access Points (APs). The variables of the metric are BadPLCP, NoPkt, and Glitch which are driver parameters determined in home environment experiments to be highly correlated to interference. Filed analysis of the proposed metric in 802.11ax and 802.11n deployments indicates that side-channel interference prevents medium access and causes frame losses, which are the main drivers of lowered QoE. Further, this paper proposes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) based algorithm to detect the interfering side-channel neighbour, where the wireless driver parameters are the input features. For 6 classes representing interference from different side-channels, we achieve 78% accuracy, 83% precision, 78% recall, and 79% f1-score.","","978-1-6654-0308-5","10.1109/BlackSeaCom52164.2021.9527858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527858","WiFi;WLAN;interference","Measurement;Wireless communication;Degradation;Estimation;Interference;IEEE 802.11ax Standard;Feature extraction","neural nets;quality of experience;radiofrequency interference;wireless channels;wireless LAN","consumer grade WiFi Access Points;metric are BadPLCP;home environment experiments;medium access;lowered QoE;deep neural network based algorithm;interfering side-channel neighbour;wireless driver parameters;different side-channels;passive side-channel interference estimation;WiFi networks;WiFi devices;2.4 GHz ISM band;overlapping side-channels;Experience impact;passive driver parameter samples;granular wireless driver parameter samples;frequency 2.4 GHz","","","","14","","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing CSI-based activity recognition approaches rely on manually designed features that are classified using traditional classification methods. Furthermore, the use of deep learning methods for CSI-based activity recognition is still at its infancy with most of the existing approaches focus on recognizing single-human activities. The current study explores the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to recognize human-to-human interactions (HHIs) using CSI signals. Particularly, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework that comprises three phases, which are the input, feature extraction, and recognition phases. The input phase converts the raw CSI signals into CSI images that comprise time, frequency, and spatial information. In the feature extraction phase, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to automatically extract deep features from the CSI images. Finally, the extracted features are fed to the recognition phase to identify the class of the HHI associated with each CSI image. The performance of our proposed framework is assessed using a publicly available CSI dataset that was acquired from 40 different pairs of subjects while performing 13 HHIs. Our proposed framework achieved an average recognition accuracy of 86.3% across all HHIs. Moreover, the experiments indicate that our proposed framework enabled significant improvements over the results achieved using three state-of-the-art pre-trained CNNs as well as the results obtained using four different conventional classifiers that employs traditional handcrafted features.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3034849","Seed-Grant Program at the German Jordanian University(grant numbers:SEEIT 02/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9243938","Two-person interaction;channel state information (CSI);human activity recognition;convolutional neural networks (CNNs);Wi-Fi;deep learning","Feature extraction;Activity recognition;Wireless fidelity;Time-frequency analysis;Deep learning;Support vector machines","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;human factors;image classification;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless LAN","Wi-Fi signals;channel state information-based human activity recognition;deep learning;end-to-end deep learning;CSI image;feature extraction phase;deep feature extraction;traditional handcrafted features;human-to-human interaction recognition;CSI-based human activity recognition;HHI recognition;convolutional neural network;CNN","","9","","56","CCBY","29 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These solutions require 2D images, depth maps or 3D point clouds of person bodies as input. In this paper, we take one step forward to show that fine-grained person perception is possible even with 1D sensors: WiFi antennas. Specifically, we used two sets of WiFi antennas to acquire signals, i.e., one transmitter set and one receiver set. Each set contains three antennas horizontally lined-up as a regular household WiFi router. The WiFi signal generated by a transmitter antenna, penetrates through and reflects on human bodies, furniture, and walls, and then superposes at a receiver antenna as 1D signal samples. We developed a deep learning approach that uses annotations on 2D images, takes the received 1D WiFi signals as input, and performs body segmentation and pose estimation in an end-to-end manner. To our knowledge, our solution is the first work based on off-the-shelf WiFi antennas and standard IEEE 802.11n WiFi signals. Demonstrating comparable results to image-based solutions, our WiFi-based person perception solution is cheaper and more ubiquitous than radars and LiDARs, while invariant to illumination and has little privacy concern comparing to cameras.","2380-7504","978-1-7281-4803-8","10.1109/ICCV.2019.00555","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9008282","","Wireless fidelity;Receiving antennas;Sensors;Two dimensional displays;Cameras;Laser radar","image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pose estimation;receiving antennas;signal detection;transmitting antennas;wireless LAN","WiFi-based person perception solution;person-in-WiFi;fine-grained person perception;WiFi antennas;receiver set;regular household WiFi router;transmitter antenna;receiver antenna;1D signal samples;body segmentation;1D sensors;signal acquisition;deep learning;1D WiFi signals;pose estimation;standard IEEE 802.11n WiFi signals","","31","","61","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Utilizing multiple fingerprints gleaned from RSS for localization is a propitious strategy to overcome the RSS susceptibility. Brimful utilization via fusing multiple fingerprint functions which supplement each other are not harnessed by existing fusion-based techniques, resulting in low localization accuracy. This paper presents a novel and robust WiFi localization modus operandi by fusing DerIvative Fingerprints of RSS with MultIple Classifiers (DIFMIC). DIFMIC first constructs a multiple fingerprints group by gleaning hyperbolic location fingerprint (HLF) and signal strength differences fingerprint (DIFF) from RSS fingerprints. Then, it obtains Multiple Fingerprints Trained Classifiers (MFTCs) via training each basic classifier with each fingerprint. To fully leverage the inherent supplementation among fingerprints and classifiers, a two-layer fusion profile (weights) joint optimization algorithm with multiple constraints is proposed. We also propose a Fusion Profile Selection (FPS) algorithm to intelligently choose fusion weights from the two-layer fusion profile for a more accurate localization. DIFMIC shows more leverage in combining multiple information, thus exhibiting better robustness in WiFi positioning. Results from our experiments reflect that DIFMIC performs better than other existing methods in real environments.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2019.2910664","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371184,61671137,61771114,61771316); Application Foundation Projects of Science; Technology Department in Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2018JY0242,2018JY0218); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8688470","Fingerprints;indoor localization;received signal strength (RSS);two-layer fusion profile;WiFi","Wireless fidelity;Fingerprint recognition;Machine learning;Machine learning algorithms;Position measurement;Optimization;Training","indoor navigation;indoor radio;RSSI;sensor fusion;wireless LAN","robust WiFi localization;derivative fingerprints;multiple classifiers;signal strength fingerprints;RSS susceptibility;brimful utilization;multiple fingerprint functions;existing fusion-based techniques;low localization accuracy;DIFMIC;multiple fingerprints group;signal strength differences fingerprint;RSS fingerprints;basic classifier;two-layer fusion profile joint optimization algorithm;Fusion Profile Selection algorithm;multiple information","","46","","30","IEEE","11 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The rise of obesity as a global epidemic makes it immensely important to monitor food habits of a modern day person. In this proposed system, we have derived an easy to adopt algorithm based on a training based model for identifying the amount of calories consumed and burnt by a person. The proposed system consists of a wrist worn MEMS accelerometer that calculates calories burned per step which is directly sent over to the user's smart phone and a cloud based machine learning algorithm that does the prediction of health habit (i.e. healthy, unhealthy or undernutrition) based on the data obtained from the wrist worn device. In order to calculate the health habit of the user, the cloud uses logistic regression with calories burnt (from MEMS accelerometer) and calories consumed (daily manual input)to predict health habit of the user. The wrist worn device extracts calories burnt per step from the change in Y-axis acceleration data of the accelerometer in the wearable device, which after self-calibration is sent over to the user's smart phone through Wi-Fi. Thus, this cloud based food habit detection not only decreases the risk of obesity in a person but also introduces a low cost alternative device with reduced power consumption of (<;13.5mW) and minimal covering size (12.56cm2) that can improve people's life.","","978-1-5386-1176-0","10.1109/ICCECE.2017.8526202","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8526202","MEMS Accelerometer;six point calibration;calories burnt;calories consumed;fitness tracker;learning algorithm;prediction;wearable band","","accelerometers;biomedical electronics;biomedical telemetry;bioMEMS;body sensor networks;calibration;health care;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;microsensors;patient monitoring;smart phones","wearable MEMS triaxial accelerometer;cloud-based machine learning algorithm;food habits;eating habits;portable system;fitness tracker platform;cloud based food habit detection;wearable device;wrist worn device extracts calories;calories burnt;health habit;smart phone;MEMS accelerometer;training based model","","1","","14","","8 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, indoor location identification is a big challenge. Many different solutions are proposed for indoor mapping however, most of these require additional hardware are also not very accurate. One of these solutions is use of received signal strength indication (RSSI) values for location mapping. Theoretically, it is possible to triangulate the location by tagging specific location point with different signal strengths received from multiple access points however this technique has many issues. It is affected by many factors like layout of the building, furniture, number of people in the area. Moreover, reflection of signals from the walls also add huge noise to the signals received. Since, many machines learning algorithms are successfully being applied in many real-world scenarios for predicting and inferring information, in this paper, we propose use of machine learning techniques on the Wi-Fi received signal strength indication (RSSI) for indoor localization. This study belongs to range-free and fingerprinting of localization. The research is divided into off-line training and on-line predicting stages. In the off-line training stage, a signal map with two-dimensional array structure is established by capturing the Wi-Fi RSSI of different reference locations, and different access points (Aps), Each output node of the neural network (NN) represents the probability that a signal vector occurs at the corresponding reference location. In the on-line predicting stage, instantaneous RSSI is recorded at an unknown location. The trained NN can accurately predict indoor positions even far from network devices.","","978-1-7281-5061-1","10.1109/ITT48889.2019.9075118","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9075118","Indoor positioning;ensemble models;Convolutional Neural Networks;Random Forest","Wireless sensor networks;Forestry;Wireless fidelity;Predictive models;Solid modeling;Sensors","indoor navigation;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;RSSI;wireless LAN","smart indoor positioning model;deterministic environment;location based services;indoor location identification;indoor mapping;additional hardware;received signal strength indication;location mapping;specific location point;different signal strengths;multiple access points;indoor localization;on-line predicting stage;off-line training stage;signal map;Wi-Fi RSSI;different reference locations;different access points;signal vector;corresponding reference location;instantaneous RSSI;unknown location;indoor positions","","2","","14","","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, besides network services, WiFi sensing is appealing in smart homes since it is device-free, cost-effective and privacy-preserving.

Without the connection of powerful cloud server and massive users, large-scale WiFi sensing is still difficult. In this paper, we firstly analyze and summarize these obstacles, and propose an efficient large-scale WiFi sensing framework, namely EfficientFi. The EfficientFi works with edge computing at WiFi APs and cloud computing at center servers. It consists of a novel deep neural network that can compress fine-grained WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) at edge, restore CSI at cloud, and perform sensing tasks simultaneously. A quantized auto-encoder and a joint classifier are designed to achieve these goals in an end-to-end fashion. To the best of our knowledge, the EfficientFi is the first IoT-cloud-enabled WiFi sensing framework that significantly reduces communication overhead while realizing sensing tasks accurately. We utilized human activity recognition and identification via WiFi sensing as two case studies, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the EfficientFi. The results show that it compresses CSI data from 1.368Mb/s to 0.768Kb/s with extremely low error of data reconstruction and achieves over 98% accuracy for human activity recognition.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3139958","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9667414","Channel state information;WiFi-based sensing;multi-task learning;variational auto-encoder;discrete representation learning;deep neural network.","Sensors;Wireless fidelity;Servers;Cloud computing;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Deep learning","","","","","","","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Body movement is crucial for sleep staging and can be combined with other indicators, such as breathing and heart rate to monitor sleep quality. Nevertheless, traditional sleep monitoring methods are inconvenient and may invade users' privacy. To solve these problems, we propose a contactless body movement recognition (CBMR) method via WiFi signals. First, CBMR uses commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices to collect channel state information (CSI) data of body movement and segment the CSI data by sliding window. Then, the context information of the segmented CSI data is learned by a bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi-RNN). Bi-RNN can fuse the forward and backward propagation information at some point, and input it into a deeper independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN) with residual mechanism to extract the deeper features and capture the time dependencies of CSI data. Finally, the type of body movement can be recognized and classified by the softmax function. CBMR can effectively reduce data preprocessing and the delay caused by manually extracting features. The results of an experiment conducted on a complex body movement data set show that our method gives desirable performance and achieves an average accuracy of greater than 93.5%, which implies a prospect application of CBMR.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2960823","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602230,61972092); Research Foundation Plan in Higher Education Institutions;; Education Bureau of Henan Province, China(grant numbers:17A520016); Zhengzhou University(grant numbers:1521337044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936937","Body movement recognition;channel state information (CSI) data;deep learning;RNN;WiFi","Wireless fidelity;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Sensors;Data mining;Time series analysis;Privacy","biomedical communication;feature extraction;geriatrics;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;pneumodynamics;recurrent neural nets;sleep;wireless channels;wireless LAN","sleep staging;sleep quality;sleep monitoring methods;contactless body movement recognition method;CBMR;WiFi signals;channel state information data;segmented CSI data;complex body movement data;bidirectional recurrent neural network;elderly people;commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices;sliding window;bi-RNN;forward propagation information;backward propagation information;feature extraction","","16","","36","IEEE","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The goal of this study is to develop a real-time motion detection and classification system that is discreet, cost-effective, and easily implementable. The system would only require an Ubuntu laptop with an Intel Ultimate N WiFi Link 5300 and a standard router. The system will be developed in two parts: (1) a robust system to track CSI variations in real-time, and (2) an algorithm to classify the motion. The system used to track CSI variance in real-time was completed in August 2018. Initial results show that introduction of motion to a previously motionless area is detected with high confidence. We present the development of (1) anomaly detection, utilizing the moving average filter implemented in the initial program and/or unsupervised machine learning, and (2) supervised machine learning algorithms to classify a set of simple motions using a proposed feature extraction methods.

Although these two techniques have been intensively studied in cellular networks, their joint optimization in Wi-Fi networks has been rarely explored as OFDMA was introduced to Wi-Fi networks for the first time in 802.11ax. The marriage of these two techniques in Wi-Fi networks creates both opportunities and challenges in the practical design of MAC-layer protocols and algorithms to optimize airtime overhead, spectral efficiency, and computational complexity. In this paper, we present DeepMux, a deep-learning-based MU-MIMO-OFDMA transmission scheme for 802.11ax networks. DeepMux mainly comprises two components: deep-learning-based channel sounding (DLCS) and deep-learning-based resource allocation (DLRA), both of which reside in access points (APs) and impose no computational/communication burden on Wi-Fi clients. DLCS reduces the airtime overhead of 802.11 protocols by leveraging the deep neural networks (DNNs). It uses uplink channels to train the DNNs for downlink channels, making the training process easy to implement. DLRA employs a DNN to solve the mixed-integer resource allocation problem, enabling an AP to obtain a near-optimal solution in polynomial time. We have built a wireless testbed to examine the performance of DeepMux in real-world environments. Our experimental results show that DeepMux reduces the sounding overhead by 62.0% ~ 90.5% and increases the network throughput by 26.3% ~ 43.6%.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2021.3087246","NSF(grant numbers:CNS-2100112,CNS-2113618); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448323","IEEE 802.11ax;machine learning;deep neural network;Wi-Fi;multi-user MIMO;OFDMA;channel sounding;resource allocation","Wireless communication;Training;Protocols;IEEE 802.11ax Standard;Downlink;Throughput;Resource management","deep learning (artificial intelligence);frequency division multiple access;MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;resource allocation;wireless channels;wireless LAN","DeepMux;IEEE 802.11ax standard;cellular networks;Wi-Fi networks;airtime overhead;MU-MIMO-OFDMA transmission scheme;deep-learning-based resource allocation;deep neural networks;mixed-integer resource allocation problem;deep-learning-based channel sounding;DLCS;AP;DLRA;DNN;OFDMA","","","","43","IEEE","8 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, wireless enterprise networks are more vulnerable than wired networks because of the broadcast feature. Thus, illegal attacks such as data theft and information forgery seriously threaten the property and information security of users and enterprises; these phenomena are attracting increasing attention from both academia and industry. Additionally, effectively detecting the attacks in the wireless enterprise networks is one of todays most important and challenging problems, especially in Wi-Fi networks, as attacks become increasingly covert and diverse. Fortunately, WiFi networks produce large amounts of data, providing copious big data for researchers. In this paper, using the Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID), which is derived from the real-world Wi-Fi network, we introduce machine learning to detect network attacks. To significantly increase the training and convergence speeds, we deploy two-dimensional data cleaning and select 18 useful attributes from the original set of 154. Then, we introduce support vector machine (SVM) to detect attacks based on the cleaned dataset. The detection accuracy for flooding attacks, injection attacks, and normal data reached 89.18%, 87.34%, and 99.88% respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a two-dimensional data cleaning method with an SVM to improve the detection accuracy for attacks. Finally, our detection results are comparable with the existing studies; however, our method operates with simpler data attributes with faster and more efficient training speed.","","978-1-5386-7946-3","10.1109/ICSPCC.2018.8567797","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8567797","","Wireless communication;Communication system security;Training;Intrusion detection;Cleaning;Support vector machines;Wireless fidelity","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;support vector machines;wireless LAN","attack detection;wireless enterprise network;wireless technology;data theft;information forgery;Wi-Fi networks;Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset;flooding attacks;injection attacks;machine learning approach;users property security;users information security;big data;support vector machine;2D data cleaning method","","2","","21","","9 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the most popular techniques for indoor localization is the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based fingerprinting approach. Since RSSI values are very complicated and noisy, conventional machine learning algorithms often suffer from limited performance. Recently developed deep learning algorithms have been shown to be powerful for the analysis of complex data. In this paper, we propose a local feature-based deep long short-term memory (LF-DLSTM) approach for WiFi fingerprinting indoor localization. The local feature extractor attempts to reduce the noise effect and extract robust local features. The DLSTM network is able to encode temporal dependencies and learn high-level representations for the extracted sequential local features. Real experiments have been conducted in two different environments, i.e., a research lab and an office. We also compare the proposed approach with some state-of-the-art methods for indoor localization. The results show that the proposed approach achieves the best localization performance with mean localization errors of 1.48 and 1.75 m under the research lab and office environments, respectively.

As a result, prediction based on semi-supervised learning techniques using limited ground truth data can be a promising approach with a slight compromise on accuracy. In this paper, an innovative method for day-ahead prediction of total building occupancy is proposed which leverages the opportunistic probing signals from a WiFi network.

To improve positioning accuracy and robustness, we consider both the spatial relation and temporal sequential relation simultaneously, and propose a spatial-temporal positioning algorithm that combines residual network and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In this algorithm, to avoid the degradation problem, we adopt the residual-based network to extract the spatial features of the Wi-Fi signal at the same time slice. Furthermore, the LSTM is used to extract temporal features of the Wi-Fi signal among successive time slices. Finally, a fully connected layer is used to obtain the final location estimation.

Most elders prefer to live independently in their own homes, which makes them more vulnerable to emergencies and leads to higher death rates. Timely detection and notification of emergencies can minimize the impact of the adversity. In this paper, we try to extract the Emergency Semantic Feature Vector (<inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ESFV$</tex-math></inline-formula>) from the ubiquitous WiFi signals in indoor environments for non-intrusive, cost-effective monitoring of the elderly and effective emergency notification. Common emergencies of the elderly are analyzed and an <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ESFV$</tex-math></inline-formula> is defined as <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ESFV = ({\lbrace \pi \rbrace,\lbrace \beta \rbrace, \lbrace \rho \rbrace })$</tex-math></inline-formula>, which is a combination of the <underline>P</underline>osition, (abnormal) <underline>B</underline>ehavior and (abnormal) <underline>R</underline>espiration of the elderly. To extract the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$ESFV$</tex-math></inline-formula> from WiFi signals, we design a WiFi signal structuring approach, which converts WiFi signals into two structured features, i.e., keypoint maps and respiration graphs, using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI). For keypoint map construction, we extract human-related WiFi signals, based on which we generate CSI maps. Meanwhile, a synchronized camera is used to extract human keypoints and annotate WiFi signals. A neural network is designed to transform the CSI maps into keypoint maps. For respiration graph extraction, we design a respiration-related WiFi signal extraction method and a subcarrier selection algorithm to obtain the respiration graphs. Then we extract the <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lbrace \pi \rbrace$</tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lbrace \beta \rbrace$</tex-math></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lbrace \rho \rbrace$</tex-math></inline-formula> from the two structured features: <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lbrace \pi \rbrace$</tex-math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lbrace \beta \rbrace$</tex-math></inline-formula> are extracted from the keypoint maps while <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$\lbrace \rho \rbrace$</tex-math></inline-formula> is extracted from the respiration graphs.

In this research, leader-follower navigation systems based on pedestrian dead reckoning are designed with wheeled mobile robot as the follower. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used as stride length model and the leader heading is obtained from magnetometer. Both data are sent to the follower through Wi-Fi. For follower system, linear model is used as robot distance model and follower heading is obtained from its magnetometer. The test shows that the best model for stride length prediction is ANN model with one hidden layer and four neuron units which has 4.65 cm training error and 5.04 cm testing error using 614 stride examples. As for robot distance model shows that the error is 2.0956 cm using 25 data samples.

Since the information in wireless signals resides in complex baseband, in this paper, we explore the use of neural networks with complex- valued weights to learn fingerprints using supervised learning. We demonstrate that, while there are potential benefits to using sections of the signal beyond just the preamble to learn fingerprints, the network cheats when it can, using information such as transmitter ID (which can be easily spoofed) to artificially inflate performance. We also show that noise augmentation by inserting additional white Gaussian noise can lead to significant performance gains, which indicates that this counter-intuitive strategy helps in learning more robust fingerprints.

Sensor acquired patient data is transformed using the HTTP protocol to cloud server using microcontroller and wi-fi module in real-time. Transformed data of patient condition is processed in the cloud server using data predictive algorithms such as Severity Defined Convolution Neural Network with respect to data collected and severity specific data thresholds and severity class predicted patient information will alarm the healthcare provider on the abnormalities detected in the patient health.

Unlike wired network, a wireless network lacks a clear boundary, which leads to significant Wi-Fi network security concerns, especially because the current security measures are prone to several types of intrusion. To address this problem, machine learning and deep learning methods have been successfully developed to identify network attacks. However, collecting data to develop models is expensive and raises privacy concerns. The goal of this paper is to evaluate a federated learning approach that would alleviate such privacy concerns. This initial work on intrusion detection is performed in a simulated environment. Once proven feasible, this process would allow edge devices to collaboratively update global anomaly detection models, without sharing sensitive training data.

Accurate activity recognition systems usually require the user to carry mobile or wearable devices, which is inconvenient for long term usage. In this paper, we design WiVi, a novel human activity recognition scheme that is able to identify common human activities in an accurate and device-free manner via multimodal machine learning using only commercial WiFi-enabled IoT devices and camera. For sensing using WiFi, a new platform is developed to extract fine-grained WiFi channel information and transform them into WiFi frames. A tailored convolutional neural network model is designed to extract high-level representative features among the WiFi frames in order to provide human activity estimation.

However, most existing people counting systems are sensor-based and can only work in some fixed gateways or checkpoints where sensors have been installed. This high dependence on the exact locations of sensors leads to low accuracy. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a smartphone-based people counting system, Wi-Counter, by leveraging the pervasive Wi-Fi infrastructure. To collect comprehensive Wi-Fi signals and people count information based on crowdsource, Wi-Counter first adopts a preprocessor to overcome the noisy, discrepant, and fragile data based on the Wiener filter and Newton interpolation. It then makes use of the designated five-layer neural network to learn the relation model between the Wi-Fi signals and the number of people. By analyzing the received Wi-Fi signals, Wi-Counter can estimate the number of people based on the resulting model. We have conducted experiments by implementing a prototype of Wi-counter based on smartphones and evaluated the system in terms of accuracy and power consumption in an indoor testbed covering an area of 96 m $^2$. Wi-Counter achieved a counting accuracy of up to 93% and exhibited reliable and robust performance resisting temporal environmental changes with negligible power usage.","2168-2305","","10.1109/THMS.2015.2401391","Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University(grant numbers:NCET-13-0908); Hong Kong RGC(grant numbers:16207714); Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:S20120011468); Shenzhen Science and Technology Foundation(grant numbers:JCYJ20140509172719309); China NSFC(grant numbers:61472259); Guangdong Science and Technology(grant numbers:2014TQ01X238); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155631","People Counting;smartphone;Wi-Fi","IEEE 802.11 Standards;Interpolation;Smart phones;Sensor systems;Noise measurement","administrative data processing;interpolation;neural nets;Newton method;smart phones;Wiener filters;wireless LAN","Wi-Counter;smartphone-based people counter;crowdsourced Wi-Fi signal data;Wireless Fidelity;people counting systems;pervasive Wi-Fi infrastructure;people count information;Wiener filter;Newton interpolation;five-layer neural network;urban applications","","36","1","27","IEEE","20 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even though there are several technological advancements made in this area, solutions like smartwatches are costly to afford and the solutions that rely on sensors and cameras suffer from privacy concerns. While wireless channel state information-based approaches can address some of these limitations, these approaches either require special hardware to be deployed or modifications at the WiFi access point. In this paper, we propose to detect human activities in a device-agnostic manner by leveraging passively captured passively captured WiFi MAC-layer traffic with the help of a sniffer. In that way, elderly people and those who suffer from chronic health conditions do not need to put any sensors on their body. This approach is not only cost-effective, but it is also easy to deploy without requiring any changes at the WiFi access point or installing special sensors in the environment. We train and test six off-the-shelf machine learning models on 15+ hours worth of WiFi MAC-layer traffic collected in a home environment. We present a proof-of-concept system prototype that employs this approach. We are able to detect six activities - (a) Walking vs Sitting, (b) Sleeping vs Awake, and (c) Using Phone vs Not Using Phone in three different real-world scenarios. Our evaluation reveals that WiFi MAC-layer traffic has special signatures to detect human activities and we are able to achieve 92.49 % detection accuracy in the best case.","2155-2509","978-1-6654-2104-1","10.1109/COMSNETS53615.2022.9668420","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668420","human activity detection;machine learning;device agnostic;WiFi traffic;sniffer","Legged locomotion;Wireless communication;Performance evaluation;Wireless sensor networks;Privacy;Prototypes;Machine learning","","","","","","13","","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the sake of effective authentication, an efficient machine learning algorithm, the XGBoost, is leveraged to train the authentication model offline. When the online authentication process begins, the coarse authentication process is initially performed according to the RSS. If suspicious, the fine authentication process is further executed according to the CSI.

We thus detect and identify cross-technology interference on off-the-shelf WiFi cards by monitoring the sequence of receiver errors (bad PLCP, bad PCS, invalid headers, etc.) and develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recognize the source of interference.

However, in the conventional work on Wi-Fi CSI based fall detection, a phenomenon is commonly observed: the classification performance degrades when data in different environments are used for learning and testing. Nonetheless, when the SNR (Signal to Noise power Ratio) is small, the conventional methods cannot capture features of motion and cannot segment signals accurately. Therefore, there is a need to address these problems in order to build a robust fall detection system. In this paper, we propose a spectrogram image-based fall detection using Wi-Fi CSI. Unlike the conventional method, CSI is segmented with a certain sliding time window, and then the classifier detects fall by using the spectrogram image generated from the segmented CSI. We use a pre-trained CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) optimized for binary classification of the spectrogram images of the fall and non-fall motions. We carried out experiments to evaluate the classification performance of our proposed method against the conventional one by using motion data in two different rooms for learning and testing. As a result, we confirmed that our proposed method outperforms the conventional one and reaches over 0.92 accuracy. In addition, compared with the conventional method, the fall detection performance of our method does not degrade even when using different environment data for learning and testing.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2022.3152315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9716074","Activity recognition;channel state information (CSI);device-free;fall detection;machine learning;WiFi.","Fall detection;Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Spectrogram;Hidden Markov models;Radar;Image segmentation","","","","","","","IEEE","17 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Li-Fi, a wireless network uses visible light spectrum to provide high-speed indoor data transmission along with illumination. As there is no interference between optical and Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum operating devices, a hybrid Li-Fi/Wi-Fi network (HLWNet) can be explored in order to improve the user Quality of Service (QoS). However, in a HLWNet system setup, user mobility may often prompt frequent handover which as a result, degrades the system throughput. In this paper, we proposed a Fuzzy Logic (FL) and fuzzy rule-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) handover decision algorithms. The FL based handover algorithm uses input parameters namely the instantaneous Signal to Interference Noise Ratio (SINR), Received Signal Strength (RSS), average SINR and user velocity to decide whether handover needs to be prompted. However, because of the increase in the number of the input parameters which, in turn, increases the number of fuzzy rules, the computational complexity greatly affects the FL system. Thus, it is envisioned that using the learning power of ANN, limited fuzzy rules are generated, which it can be made to learn from the limited rules and be able generalize to make handover decision. Based on the accuracy test conducted, the FL based handover decision algorithm is 1.66 times more accurate than the ANN fuzzy rule-based handover decision algorithm in terms of successfully assigning access points (AP) to users.","","978-1-7281-7089-3","10.1109/ICISS49785.2020.9316116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9316116","Artificial neural network (ANN);fuzzy logic (FL);light fidelity (Li-Fi);wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi)","Handover;Fuzzy logic;Light fidelity;Wireless fidelity;Quality of service;Radio frequency;Load modeling","free-space optical communication;fuzzy logic;fuzzy neural nets;indoor communication;mobility management (mobile radio);quality of service;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi Networks;wireless network;visible light spectrum;high-speed indoor data transmission;HLWNet system setup;frequent handover;fuzzy rules;FL based handover decision algorithm;ANN fuzzy rule-based handover decision algorithm;hybrid Li-Fi networks;quality of service;access points","","1","","43","","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and Bluetooth beacons are deployed in most indoor environments to provide service for the Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Although, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi target different applications, they both share the 2.4 GHz frequency band. The re-transmissions caused by interference with Wi-Fi packets is costly for BLE in terms of energy consumption. Techniques such as Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) in BLE addresses this problem. However, the static nature of AFH is not performing well for highly dynamic environments. Therefore, there is a need for a predictive model to optimize the spectrum usage. In this paper, we propose a machine learning model based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the wireless activities in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and its impact on BLE channels. We apply the proposed model to analyze the Wi-Fi interference trend on these channels. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) results for several experiments on both channels indicate the high performance of the proposed LSTM model over Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.

However, WiFi signal strengths not only vary with time, different smartphone configurations, different ambient conditions including open/closed room, presence/absence of persons and other interfering devices etc. but also it depends on the granularity of positioning. It is easier to achieve good room level accuracy but more precise positioning is difficult. Most of the existing works fix one granularity level for a given context for their work. But the variation of both positioning granularity in terms of how much area is covered by one coordinate location (that is, one grid), and context heterogeneity should be considered as these variations typically affect localization accuracy. Thus, it is necessary to select stable WiFi Access Points (APs) that provide significant localization accuracy for various context and different granularity (grid sizes). Consequently, in this paper, an algorithm that selects stable APs for the most appropriate positioning granularity that minimizes the localization error. Hence, WiFi signal strengths are collected from an entire floor of a building on our University campus. This experimental testbed is divided based on the different size of grids and data has been collected from every possible grid subject to the temporal, ambiance and device heterogeneity for two months. Based on the localization error and ground truth, grids of 1 × 1 sq.m. are considered. Using 20 stable APs out of 43 APs, an ensemble method achieved 96.62% localization accuracy and BayesNet provides 4.54% localization error.","","978-1-5386-9279-0","10.1109/WiSPNET45539.2019.9032859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9032859","Indoor localization;Machine learning;WiFi;RSSI;Stable AP","Wireless fidelity;Machine learning;Buildings;Training;Androids;Humanoid robots;Data collection","indoor navigation;indoor radio;radionavigation;smart phones;wireless LAN","stable WiFi access points;WiFi network infrastructure;wireless access points subject;stable set;indoor localization;localization error;localization accuracy;device heterogeneity;possible grid subject;appropriate positioning granularity;grid sizes;significant localization accuracy;context heterogeneity;coordinate location;granularity level;precise positioning;good room level accuracy;interfering devices;different ambient conditions;different smartphone configurations;WiFi signal strengths;indoor environments;smartphone users;Location Based Services;WiFi-based indoor positioning system;varying granularity levels","","3","","23","","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a smart grid, demand-side management plays a crucial role in reducing the generation capacity by shifting the user energy consumption from peak period to off-peak period, which requires detailed knowledge of the user consumption at the individual appliance level. Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) provides an exceptionally low-cost solution for determining individual appliance levels using a single-point measurement. This paper proposed an IoT-based real-time non-intrusive load classification (RT-NILC) system considering the variability of supply voltage using low-frequency data. Due to the unavailability of smart meters at the household level in Bangladesh, a data-acquisition system (DAS) is developed. The DAS is capable of measuring and storing rms voltage, rms current, active power, and power factor data at a sampling rate of 1 Hz. These data are processed to train different multilabel classification models. The best-performed classification model has been selected and utilized for the implementation of RT-NILC over IoT. The Firebase real-time online database is considered for data storage to flow the data in two-way between end-user and service provider (energy distributor). The GPRS module is used for wireless data transmission as a Wi-Fi network may not be available everywhere. Windows and web applications are developed for data visualization. The proposed system has been validated in real-time, using rms voltage, rms current, and active power measurements at a real house. Even under supply voltage variability, the performance evaluation of the RT-NILC system has shown an average classification accuracy of more than 94%. Good classification accuracy and the overall operation of the IoT-based information exchange systems ensure the proposed system’s applicability for efficient energy management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104263","Jashore University of Science and Technology (JUST), Bangladesh, under the project entitled “Energy Saver System for Domestic Loads”; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511265","Non-intrusive load monitoring;real-time load classification;IoT framework;machine learning;variation of supply voltage","Real-time systems;Home appliances;Databases;Voltage measurement;Machine learning;Data acquisition;Load modeling","","","","","","47","CCBY","11 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The traditional semantic location recognition methods require partitioning the location and registering all the information to construct Wi-Fi map for fine localization, which is not practical in daily life and continuous attempt for recognizing semantic location makes smartphone battery last shorter time. Even worse, they have low accuracy when recognizing the locations located near to each other. In this paper, we propose a hybrid location recognition approach. The proposed method combines k-nearest neighbor with decision tree to recognize semantic locations. It consists of moving status detection, indoor/outdoor environment check and location recognition which consists of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and decision tree. The proposed method can be used in indoor or dense urban environments where traditional approaches fail.

In this article, we propose a multimodal channel state information-based activity recognition (MCBAR) system that leverages existing WiFi infrastructures and monitors human activities from CSI measurements. MCBAR aims to address the performances degradation of WiFi-based human recognition systems due to environmental dynamics. Specifically, we address the issue of nonuniformly distributed unlabeled data with rarely performed activities by taking advantages of the generative adversarial network (GAN) and semisupervised learning. We apply a multimodal generator to approximate the CSI data distribution in different environment settings with limited measured CSI data. The generated CSI data using the multimodal generator can provide better diversity for knowledge transfer. This multimodal generator improves the ability of MCBAR to recognize specific activities with various CSI patterns caused by environmental dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art CSI-based recognition systems, MCBAR is more robust as it is able to handle the nonuniformly distributed CSI data collected from a new environment setting. In addition, diverse generated data from the multimodal generator improves the stability of the system. We have tested MCBAR under multiple experimental settings at different places.

This paper presents a convolutional neural network (CNN) based approach for indoor localization using RSS time-series from wireless local area network (WLAN) access points. Applying CNN on a time-series of RSS readings is expected to reduce the noise and randomness present in separate RSS values and hence improve the localization accuracy.

In this paper, we propose to use a mid-grained intermediate-level channel measurement - spatial beam signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) that are inherently available and defined in the IEEE 802.11ad/ay standards - to construct the fingerprinting database. These intermediate channel measurements are further utilized by a deep learning approach for multiple purposes: 1) location-only classification; 2) simultaneous location-and-orientation classification; and 3) direct coordinate estimation. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the framework is thoroughly validated by an in-house experimental platform consisting of 3 access points using commercial-off-the-shelf millimeter-wave WiFi routers. The results show a 100% accuracy if the location is only interested, about 99% for simultaneous location-and-orientations classification, and an averaged root mean-square error (RMSE) of 11.1 cm and an average median error of 9.5 cm for direct coordinate estimate, greater than 2-fold improvements over the RMSE of 28.7 cm and median error of 23.6 cm for RSSI-like single SNR-based localization.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2991129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9081910","Indoor localization;WiFi;millimeter wave;fingerprinting;machine learning;deep neural networks;location;orientation;coordinate estimation","Wireless fidelity;Signal to noise ratio;Estimation;Training;Fingerprint recognition;Sensors;Deep learning","indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;millimetre wave communication;radio direction-finding;telecommunication network routing;wireless channels;wireless LAN","fine-grained channel state information;fingerprinting database;location-only classification;averaged root mean-square error;RSSI-like single SNR-based localization;MMWave WiFi;direct coordinate estimation;CSI;coarse-grained received signal strength indicator measurements;physical layer received signal strength indicator measurements;RSSI measurements;midgrained intermediate-level channel measurement;spatial beam signal-to-noise ratios;SNR;IEEE 802.11ad-ay standards;simultaneous location-and-orientation classification;millimeter-wave WiFi routers;RMSE;fingerprint-based indoor localization;deep learning approach;size 11.1 cm;size 9.5 cm;size 28.7 cm;size 23.6 cm","","26","","68","CCBY","29 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The synthetic datasets are often unrealistic in terms of waveforms or protocols, and the raw captures are typically unlabeled (or often mislabeled), and can skew machine learning algorithms to focus on non-salient features. Further, the associated storage and processing requirements are quite large. In this work, a novel dataset generation and augmentation method called policy-based synthesis is presented that aims to address the short-comings of either approach by combining basic protocol knowledge with simulated channel and device impairments to supplement over-the-air captures made in a controlled environment. This method permits the learning of salient features and regularizes radio and device anomalies that are not of interest. Practical considerations for collecting and processing data for this hybridized approach are also detailed and examples are provided on a dataset that includes protocols commonly used in the 2.4 GHz ISM band such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.","","978-1-7281-2723-1","10.1109/GlobalSIP45357.2019.8969160","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8969160","RF;machine learning;dataset generation;dataset augmentation;signal processing","","Bluetooth;learning (artificial intelligence);protocols;wireless LAN","policy based synthesis;data generation;augmentation methods;current dataset generation methods;RF Machine Learning tasks consist;completely raw digitized data;RF front end;synthetic datasets;raw captures;nonsalient features;associated storage;processing requirements;novel dataset generation;augmentation method;policy-based synthesis;basic protocol knowledge;simulated channel;device impairments;over-the-air captures;salient features;device anomalies;collecting processing data;frequency 2.4 GHz","","","","11","","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, even the latest Wi-Fi technology is still ready to accommodate these large amounts of data. Accurately setting the contention window (CW) value significantly affects the efficiency of the Wi-Fi network. Unfortunately, the standard collision resolution used by IEEE 802.11ax networks is nonscalable; thus, it cannot maintain stable throughput for an increasing number of stations, even when Wi-Fi 6 has been designed to improve performance in dense scenarios. To this end, we propose a CW control strategy for Wi-Fi 6 systems. This strategy leverages deep learning to search for optimal configuration of CW under different network conditions. Our deep neural network is trained by data generated from a Wi-Fi 6 simulation system with some varying key parameters, e.g., the number of nodes, short interframe space (SIFS), distributed interframe space (DIFS), and data transmission rate. Numerical results demonstrated that our deep learning scheme could always find the optimal CW adjustment multiple by adaptively perceiving the channel competition status. The finalized performance of our model has been significantly improved in terms of system throughput, average transmission delay, and packet retransmission rate.

In this paper, we present a new class of methods for detecting whether or not two Wi-Fi–enabled devices are in immediate physical proximity, i.e. 2 or fewer meters apart, as established by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Our goal is to enhance the accuracy of smartphone-based exposure notification and contact tracing systems. We present a set of binary machine learning classifiers that take as input pairs of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprints. We empirically verify that a single classifier cannot generalize well to a range of different environments with vastly different numbers of detectable Wi-Fi Access Points (APs). However, specialized classifiers, tailored to situations where the number of detectable APs falls within a certain range, are able to detect immediate physical proximity significantly more accurately. As such, we design three classifiers for situations with low, medium, and high numbers of detectable APs. These classifiers distinguish between pairs of RSSI fingerprints recorded 2 or fewer meters apart and pairs recorded further apart but still in Bluetooth range. We characterize their balanced accuracy for this task to be between 66.8% and 77.8%.","2471-917X","978-1-6654-0402-0","10.1109/IPIN51156.2021.9662516","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9662516","Wi-Fi;RSSI;fingerprinting;proximity detection;heterogeneous devices;contact tracing;machine learning;attribute bagging;feature selection","Meters;COVID-19;Bluetooth;Pandemics;Indoor navigation;Machine learning;Fingerprint recognition","","","","","","19","","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Comparatively, deep neural networks (DNN) can learn deep transferable features to manifest invariant factors underlying different domains. Thus, we propose a Deep Mean Correlation Alignment (DMCA) domain adaptation network to reduce the domain discrepancy efficiently. DMCA can learn transferable features from domain shift minimization by aligning the mean embeddings of the hidden representation in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and aligning the second-order statics of hidden representation of different domains.

Recently a few works have explored applicability of machine learning techniques to this problem. However, the challenging task of accurately finding the position depends on prior efforts of fingerprinting. Another challenge is that, distance sensitivity of signal strength depends on proximity to the access point. Heterogeneity of devices adds new dimension to the challenge. Existing solutions mostly aim at fingerprinting under the set of conditions considered so that training and test data can be taken under similar experimental setup. In this paper, an ensemble of condition based classifiers are designed for indoor localization that handles device heterogeneity, temporal heterogeneity and context heterogeneity (door and window open/close, presence/absence of other users in vicinity). We have created an indoor localization data set where data is collected in above mentioned dimensions. When the training and test data sets are taken under similar environmental conditions with same devices, the average classification accuracy ranges between 72.2% to 92.6%. But for a validation set which contains examples for every conditions, the classifiers achieve an average maximum accuracy of 74.8% when individual training set corresponding to specific conditions are used. To avoid these conditional dependencies we have used an ensemble of condition specific K-nearest neighbour classifiers which enables us to predict the location with 96% accuracy.","","978-1-5090-2193-2","10.1109/ANTS.2016.7947872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7947872","Indoor localization;machine learning;RSSI;Wi-Fi;ensemble classifier","Training;Databases;Wireless fidelity;Data collection;Testing;Machine learning algorithms;Context","indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);radiofrequency identification;signal classification;statistical analysis","indoor localization;condition based classifiers;radiofrequency fingerprinting;Wi-Fi signals;machine learning techniques;device heterogeneity;temporal heterogeneity;context heterogeneity;k-nearest neighbour classifiers","","8","","14","","15 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To automatically retain low noise data for identification, we propose a self-paced dense convolutional network (SPDCN), which consists of the self-paced loss function based on a modified convolutional neural network, together with a dense convolutional network. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to show the merits of WiWrite, revealing that, the recognition accuracies for the same-size input and different-size input are 93.6% and 89.0%, respectively.

In this work, we propose to combine inertial sensor-based user motion measurement and sensed WiFi signals to enable WiFi fingerprint database construction in a Crowdsource manner. Pedestrians whose smart phone are equipped with our software could contribute his walking trace and WiFi signals to our system without explicit effort. User trajectories are modeled with GraphSLAM which requires a certain number of landmarks for better calibration.

However, the performance of CNN is architecture dependant, and thus an architecture that works well in one case may not work in another, especially for the WiFi-based localisation problems. Most of the solutions use an existing hand-crafted architecture or a semi-automated CNN design for fingerprinting, which requires significant CNN expertise and time. Therefore, a satisfactory solution may not be guaranteed as it is challenging to design numerous possible architectures. In this work, we address this challenge by developing a framework that completely automates the CNN architecture design process. Our automated architectures based on VGG blocks have shown superior performance compared to standard architectures such as VGG-16. We further explore three different heuristics for automation: Bayesian optimisation, Hyperband, and Random Search and demonstrate their importance towards the automated CNN architecture development for WiFi fingerprinting. Experiments are conducted on real-world datasets and, a comparative study between our automated architecture and other models is presented. This work would, therefore, facilitate the CNN design for indoor localisation.","2471-917X","978-1-6654-0402-0","10.1109/IPIN51156.2021.9662642","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9662642","WiFi Fingerprinting;Automated Convolutional Neural Network;Bayesian optimisation;Hyperband;Random Search","Indoor navigation;Neural networks;Fingerprint recognition;Bayes methods;Convolutional neural networks;Wireless fidelity;Floors","","","","","","23","","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, most WiFi-based indoor localization systems have complex models and high localization delays, which limit the universality of these localization methods. To solve these problems, we propose a depthwise separable convolution based passive indoor localization system (DSCP) using Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). DSCP is a fingerprint-based localization system, which includes an offline training phase and an online localization phase. In the offline training phase, the indoor scenario is first divided into different areas to set training locations for collecting CSI. Then amplitude differences of these CSI subcarriers are extracted for constructing location fingerprints, thereby training the CNN. In the online localization phase, CSI data is first collected at the test locations, then the location fingerprint is extracted and finally fed to the trained network to obtain the predicted location. The experimental results show that DSCP has a short training time and a low localization delay. DSCP achieves a high localization accuracy, upper than 97%, and a small median localization distance error of 0.98 m in open indoor scenarios.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-3106-1","10.1109/WCNC45663.2020.9120638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9120638","channel state information;indoor localization;location fingerprint;convolutional neural network","Location awareness;Training;Convolution;Frequency-domain analysis;Neural networks;Fingerprint recognition;Delays","convolutional neural nets;indoor navigation;indoor radio;radionavigation;wireless LAN","CSI fingerprint;Wi-Fi-based indoor localization;high localization delays;DSCP;Wi-Fi channel state information;fingerprint-based localization system;offline training phase;online localization phase;training locations;location fingerprint;trained network;short training time;low localization delay;high localization accuracy;median localization distance error;depthwise separable convolution based passive indoor localization system;CSI data collection;CSI subcarrier extraction;location fingerprints;test locations;size 0.98 m","","6","","19","","19 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It not only facilitates people's lives but also creates enormous economic value. However, during the propagation of the WiFi signal, it is easily interfered by obstacles, and the signal fluctuation is significant, resulting in low accuracy of positioning. To overcome these problems, we reduce the influence of environmental factors firstly. Then the positioning accuracy is improved by using the SVM model to distinguish the NLOS or LOS environment and employing the capsule networks to derive the users' positions with the WiFi 2.4G and 5G signals. As we all know, the WiFi 2.4G signal has excellent penetrability and is less affected by obstacles, while the WiFi 5G signal has excellent stability and small fluctuations. Therefore, we use the advantages of these two kinds of signals to derive the optimal suggestion by the capsule neural network, which is the learning system with minimum data sets needed. The experimental results show that the positioning effect of the two signals simultaneously is better than the positioning effect of a single signal. We also compare with the traditional indoor positioning methods and use the simulation data to carry out the robustness test, and the positioning accuracy reached 0.99 m in the field environment finally.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827474","Indoor localization;NLOS and LOS channel propagation condition;WiFi 24G and WiFi 5G;SVM;capsule network","Wireless fidelity;5G mobile communication;Dual band;Training;Learning systems;Stability analysis;Data models","5G mobile communication;Global Positioning System;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines;wireless LAN","signal fuse learning method;dual bands WiFi signal measurements;indoor localization technology;signal fluctuation;positioning accuracy;WiFi 2.4G signal;WiFi 5G signal;positioning effect;single signal;traditional indoor positioning methods;economic value","","11","","40","CCBY","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many different solutions have been proposed that rely on various data inputs, including Wi-Fi and camera input. Some proposed methods have used auxiliary data inputs such as BLE Beacons. However, any auxiliary input would require additional infrastructure to purchase and maintain, increasing expenses. This paper explores a variety of indoor positioning techniques that do not require any additional infrastructure beyond what is typically found in a commercial environment. This research explores, implements, and measures, through standardized tests, Wi-Fi RSSI, RTT, and marker-based trilateration, as well as, fingerprinting with two separate machine learning models, and also tests an implementation of PoseNet. It compares and contrasts the various methods, categorizing them according to a proposed set of criteria for evaluating a commercially deployable indoor positioning solution. The paper closes with a brief summary of the techniques that were studied and proposes investigation into various related topics and improvements, as well as future directions.","2471-917X","978-1-6654-0402-0","10.1109/IPIN51156.2021.9662632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9662632","Augmented reality;Computer vision;Distance measurement;Indoor navigation;Machine learning;Neural networks;Pose estimation;Position measurement;Visual odometry;Wireless access point","Indoor navigation;Machine learning;Interference;Position measurement;Fingerprint recognition;Hardware;Sensors","Bluetooth;Global Positioning System;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;smart phones;wireless LAN","auxiliary data inputs;auxiliary input;additional infrastructure;indoor positioning techniques;Wi-Fi RSSI;commercially deployable indoor positioning solution;accurate indoor positioning;modern smartphones;wide suite;internal sensors;traditional positioning methods;camera input","","","","55","IEEE","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present a data driven approach to alleviate this issue, focusing on Wi-Fi usage by the user's perspective. We model the Wi-Fi usage of mobile users based on their past usage to predict usage requirements. This allows intelligently switching on the Wi-Fi interface only if the user context demands. Thus, it reduces long periods of time being in the idle state and significantly lessens the number of futile network scans. Based on the trace data collected from Rice-Livelab study, we extract temporal, application usage, operational state and location context data to build our prediction model. This study includes a systematic feature engineering process followed by the deployment of machine learning algorithms on the target dataset.

In this paper, we propose Wisual, a Channel State Information (CSI) based device-free crowd density estimation framework and can visualize the distribution of people. The major challenge of Wisual is how to extract proper quantifiable indexes to distinguish the path information of multiple targets and maximize the resolution of crowd density estimation. To address this challenge, Wisual first presents a method for estimating the frequency of the CSI propagation path (FoC) for the moving persons and constructs a joint multi-feature parameter (JMFP) spectrum matrix with the other two parameters. Then the multi-target spectrum matrix is put into a proposed deep-learning model called CSI stream 3D convolutional neural networks (CS-3DCNN) for implementing crowd density estimation and the target path information differentiation. Finally, Wi-Fi imaging is implemented based on the 2D-MUSIC algorithm, which shows the approximate distribution situation of indoor persons through the spectrograms. The experimental results in typical real-world scenes demonstrate that Wisual can forecast the crowd density with 98% precision and accurately display the frequency spectra of moving persons.

To exploit frequency diversity in Wi-Fi channels, the access point should measure the channel quality and coordinate the channel contention for all the stations. However, there is a tradeoff between achieving the frequency diversity gain and sustaining protocol efficiency because the channel estimation and coordination consume time and frequency resource that ideally should be used for data transfer. In this paper, we present Diversity-aware Wi-Fi (D-Fi), a novel PHY/MAC protocol, that efficiently exploits frequency diversity. In particular, D-Fi leverages an OFDM-based Bloom filter that synergistically integrates two operations: (i) the channel quality estimation and (ii) the contention based channel allocation. D-Fi also employs a machine learning (ML) method to resolve the false-positive ambiguity caused by the Bloom filter. Furthermore, we develop a decentralized algorithm, called Kε-greedy, based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework, so that it achieves sub-optimal performance by studying the gain for exploring new channel quality information. We implement the prototype of D-Fi on the USRP/GNURadio to validate the feasibility of our work. The experiments and trace-driven simulations show that D-Fi provides up to 3 x throughput improvement compared to the existing solutions.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2014.2326602","IT R&D program of MSIP/KEIT; National Research Foundation of Korea; MSIP(grant numbers:2012R1A1A1014755,2013R1A1A1006823); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6819850","Diversity;Wi-Fi;Bloom filter;PHY/MAC protocols;machine learning;multi-armed bandit problem","OFDM;Frequency diversity;Channel estimation;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Media Access Protocol;Mobile computing","access protocols;channel allocation;channel estimation;data structures;OFDM modulation;optimisation;wireless LAN","frequency diversity-aware Wi-Fi;OFDM-based Bloom filters;throughput optimization;access point;channel contention;frequency diversity gain;channel estimation;frequency resource;PHY-MAC protocol;D-Fi leverages;channel quality estimation;channel allocation;machine learning;false-positive ambiguity;Kε-greedy;multiarmed bandit framework;USRP-GNURadio;trace-driven simulations","","6","","38","IEEE","22 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we develop WiHAR-an unobtrusive Wi-Fi-based activity recognition system. WiHAR uses the Wi-Fi network interface card to capture the channel state information (CSI) data. These CSI data are effectively processed, and then amplitude and phase information is used to obtain the spectrogram. In the subsequent step, the time-variant mean Doppler shift (MDS) caused by the human body movements in the radio signals before their arrival at the receiver is estimated. The MDS is used to extract time and frequency domain features that are needed to train the supervised learning algorithms (i.e., decision tree, linear discriminant analysis, and support vector machines (SVM)) to assess the performance of the WiHAR.

Specifically, a Machine Learning (ML) based Network Service Detection (NSD) module is developed which can detect the current network service in real time and update the STA wake interval according to the corresponding service latency requirement. Moreover, a novel data time estimation model is developed which can estimate the required throughput and wake duration with the observed throughput, linkspeed, and contention level.

The positioning accuracy of Wi-Fi fingerprinting approach can be improved by collecting large amount of labeled data with diverse set of hardware devices, orientation angles, and environmental conditions. However, the cost of data collection becomes prohibitive. In crowdsourcing method, volunteers who frequently visit the indoor space, contribute unlabeled but diverse trajectories. However, despite the potential to collect large quantities of data, unlabeled trajectories produce large positioning errors. In this paper, we propose a novel method where we only collect a base-fingerprinting set with a limited number of devices, orientation angles, and environmental conditions. Then, we develop RSSI model which allows us to simulate device & orientation angle and environmental conditions diversity as noises that are added on top of RSSI values in the base-fingerprinting set. We then generate a very large set of fully labeled diverse virtual trajectories to train appropriate deep learning models for use in the online-phase of Wi-Fi fingerprinting method. In this paper, we train 1-D convolutional neural network (1-D CNN) models called base- and diverse-models. Base-model is trained on the virtual trajectories obtained exclusively from the base-fingerprinting set. On the other hand, diverse-model is trained on the so-called noisy trajectories which are created with the help of RSSI model. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we perform experiments in our campus library. When the online-phase trajectory is coming from hardware & orientation angles and environmental conditions not used for data collection, the diverse-model achieves an average mean square error of 1.24m as compared to 19.25m for the base-model.

However, the accuracy degradation problem may be introduced as crowd customers are not professional trained and equipped. Therefore, we define two concepts: fixed landmark and hint landmark, to rectify the fingerprint database in the practical system, in which common corridor crossing points serve as fixed landmark and cross point among different crowd paths serve as hint landmark. Machine-learning techniques are utilized for short range approximation around fixed landmarks and fuzzy logic decision technology is applied for searching hint landmarks in crowd traces space.

Recently, various machine learning techniques have been developed to tackle the problems of IPS.

However, the variation of Received Signal Strength (RSS) at any specific location due to the indoor fading issue leads to serious challenges in the accuracy of the distance estimates. In this paper, we propose a new technique by using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) multi-classifier based on Multiple Service Set Identifiers (MSSIDs) that are configured on the same access point. A spatial voting scenario for three PNN-classifiers is proposed as a tool to determine the location of the user. Using a spatial voting based technique is specifically designed to tackle the negative impact of the multi-path propagation on the performance of IPS. The proposed system is performed inside the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (CEAS) at Western Michigan University. The performance of the proposed system compared with some of the common methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and multi-class support vector machine (SVM). According to the experimental results, the spatial voting of the three PNN-dassifiers can significantly mitigate the adverse effects of RSS variation. The performance of the multi-classifier exhibits superior performance to that of the other single classifiers in all Area of Interest (AOI).

However, positioning inaccuracies inherent to GNSS-based positioning can reduce the application coverage. Areas such as urban canyons with limited satellite view and poor PDOP (position dilution of precision) could cause significant positioning errors. To complement the inefficacy of positioning in such urban environment, we conducted a study into the effectiveness of using WIFI fingerprinting technology to complement GNSS-based positioning for vehicle positioning in an urban environment. WIFI fingerprinting positioning complements well with GNSS-based positioning in that although there is limited satellite view in urban environment, there are an abundance of WIFI signals. In this paper, we present the results of our study conducted in the Singapore Jurong Lake District. Data collection of WIFI signals were performed using an Android APP running on a mobile device by driving around the area. The WIFI signal data are then processed and stored in a WIFI fingerprint database. A navigation APP was developed to compute the vehicle position based on measured WIFI signals and WIFI fingerprint data from the database. The vehicle position can then be displayed on a map live, just like a GNSS-based navigation device. We studied two methods of fingerprinting-based positioning. The first method uses the kNN method in which WIFI signal strengths information is taken into the positioning computation. The second method uses a simpler approach without using signal strengths. The positioning accuracies obtained using these two methods of WIFI fingerprinting are discussed. The results showed that WIFI fingerprinting-based positioning may be a feasible complement to GNSS in providing positioning for vehicle navigation in an urban environment.","","978-1-4673-9944-9","10.1109/WF-IoT.2018.8355136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8355136","Vehicle positioning;localization;WIFI fingerprinting","","mobile computing;nearest neighbour methods;road vehicles;satellite navigation;wireless LAN","vehicle positioning;urban environment;automatic vehicle navigation;low-cost GNSS receivers;WIFI fingerprinting technology;WIFI signal data;WIFI fingerprint database;measured WIFI signals;WIFI signal strengths information;positioning computation;positioning accuracies;position dilution of precision;WIFI fingerprinting positioning;GNSS-based navigation device;fingerprinting-based positioning;kNN method","","1","","14","","7 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike previous studies, this article proposes to count the in-and-out visitors to monitor visiting frequency and population, which can be applied for many indoor places, such as shops and restaurants. Therefore, we present the first WiFi-based in-and-out visitor counting system, Door-Monitor, which obtains the direction (enter or exit) and the number of visitors passing by the door. The WiFi signals enable us to count the visitors in a low-cost and nonintrusive way, and it can tell the exact number of visitors even when multiple persons pass by the door simultaneously. To detect the visitors' passing direction, we show that the patterns in the phase difference series can indicate the entering and exiting passing directions by analyzing the effects of the passing behavior on the signal's phase information. To count the passing visitors, we perform a short time Fourier transformation on the phase difference series to generate the spectrogram, on which the convolutional neural network is applied for building a counting model.

Considering this, very few technologies exist to aid the farmers in selecting the right crops depending on the environmental factors. Moreover most irrigation systems all around the world require at least some form of human intervention. Considering this, the proposed smart farming solution aims to aid the farmers by means of technology so as to increase their yield by suggesting to them the crops that will be most profitable for them as well as automating the irrigation system for them. This in turn will be a major help to the agriculture community as a whole and also set free the farmers from certain rudimentary tasks.","","978-1-7281-6851-7","10.1109/ICCCNT49239.2020.9225686","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9225686","Wi-Fi Enabled Microcontroller;Web Server;Mobile App;Machine Learning;Random Forest Algorithm;Soil Temperature Sensor;Water Level Sensor;Soil Moisture Sensor;Submersible Water Pump;Temperature and Humidity Sensor","Agriculture;Sensors;Temperature sensors;Irrigation;Soil moisture;Sensor systems;Mobile applications","crops;environmental factors;farming;humidity sensors;irrigation;mobile computing;profitability;random forests;temperature sensors;water pumps;wireless LAN","humidity sensor;submersible water pump;soil moisture sensor;soil temperature sensor;random forest algorithm;machine learning;mobile application;Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller;rudimentary tasks;profitability;real time crop prediction;agriculture community;smart farming solution;human intervention;environmental factors;crops;automatic irrigation system;virtual farmer","","","","15","","15 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The position references are using existing working access points around the location. All of the noises and disturbances are real noises generated by the traffic. The algorithms for magnetic fingerprint are K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and first position. The WiFi method uses multilateration algorithm. Geo-magnetism IPS uses 36 fingerprint data every 1.44m2. This approach results in 4.08m deviation with first position algorithm and 4.09m deviation with KNN. The WiFi RSS IPS uses multiple n values and multiple brand of access points.

An observation is that there exists a certain subcarrier that can best estimate the location of the target. Based on it, we propose MobiFi to leverage deep learning to automatically select the best subcarrier. MobiFi mainly consists of two steps: First, a lightweight end-to-end Convolution Neural Network (CNN) is taken as the backbone network to extract features and do classification while avoiding serious overfitting. After selecting the best subcarrier by the first two steps, MobiFi calculates the AoA estimation and corresponding location estimation in the same way as SpotFi. Since the backbone network is lightweight, MobiFi can realize near real-time on mobile devices with guaranteed localization performance. Extensive experiments show that MobiFi is comparable to SpotFi; both methods achieve a median AoA estimation error of 8.6° and median location estimation error of 1. 5m in an indoor office scenario. At the same time, MobiFi which consumes less than 0. 21s and 1. 7s on Personal Computer (PC) and mobile devices respectively is 5 times faster than SpotFi.

This paper investigates the feasibility of using UWB technology for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The key idea is to use machine learning classification algorithms most suited to train models to classify different activities using the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) data of the UWB signals. Our experiments show that by using CIR data as features we can classify simple activities such as standing, sitting, lying with an accuracy of 95%. To compare this performance, we have also trained statistical models using Wi-Fi CSI. We found that, for all models UWB CIR significantly outperformed Wi-Fi CSI.

A Neural Network (NN) will be used for the network state estimation and ST for reasoning about required actions. It is based on semantic data sets mining such that coordination decisions may be driven by predictions instead of using physical spectrum sensing devices.

A complex multilayer passive circuit has been segmented into uncoupled sections which are then modeled using lumped circuit models that ensure broadband correlation with EM based data. The complete circuit model which includes all parasitics is then optimized and mapped using polynomial relations to geometrical parameters such as width, length and spacing of the components. To control the insertion loss (IL) of the circuit, the inductor geometries are optimized based on area constraints using nonlinear mapping based on ANN.

The most popular Wi-Fi positioning algorithm is the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Due to the excessive amount of RSSI data, clustering algorithms are generally adopted to classify the data before KNN positioning. However, the traditional clustering algorithms cannot maintain data integrity after the classification. To solve the problem, this paper puts forward an improved public c-means (IPC) clustering algorithm with high accuracy in indoor environment, and uses the algorithm to optimize the fingerprint database. After being trained in the database, all fingerprint points were divided into several classes. Then, the range of each class was determined by comparing the cluster centers. To optimize the clustering effect, the points in the border area between two classes were allocated to these classes simultaneously, pushing up the positioning accuracy in this area. The experimental results show that the IPC clustering algorithm achieved better accuracy with lighter computing load than FCM clustering and k-means clustering, and could be coupled with KNN or FS-KNN to achieve good positioning effect.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2937464","North China University of Technology(grant numbers:XN019009); Scientific Research Project of Beijing Educational Committee(grant numbers:KM201710009004); North China University of Technology(grant numbers:110051360007); Research Project on Teaching Reform and Curriculum Construction of North China University of Technology(grant numbers:18XN009-011); 2019 Beijing University Student Scientific Research and Entrepreneurship Action Plan Project(grant numbers:218051360019XN004); 2019 Education and Teaching Reform General Project of North China University of Technology(grant numbers:108051360019XN141/021); 2019 Fundamental Research Funds for Beijing Universities(grant numbers:110052971921/004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812713","Wi-Fi;indoor positioning;improved public c-means (IPC) clustering algorithm;the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm","Clustering algorithms;Fingerprint recognition;Databases;Wireless fidelity;Classification algorithms;Euclidean distance;Received signal strength indicator","indoor navigation;indoor radio;nearest neighbour methods;RSSI;wireless LAN","IPC clustering algorithm;FCM clustering;Wi-Fi-based indoor positioning technology;indoor Wi-Fi;received signal strength indicator signals;k-nearest neighbors algorithm;RSSI data;KNN positioning;indoor environment;Wi-Fi positioning algorithm;improved public C-means clustering algorithm","","9","","19","CCBY","26 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The dynamic hand gesture recognition technology based on WiFi signal plays an important role. However, although the gesture recognition system using Channel State Information (CSI) has made great progress, we have observed that in the current research, most commercial network cards can not directly extract such signals, and the easily acquired received signal strength (RSS) can only recognize simple gestures. Therefore, in this paper, we present a universal framework to achieve dynamic hand gesture detection and recognition with RSS. We use RSS from multiple independent WiFi nodes to increase the upper limit of recognize capability, enabling the system to recognize seven complex dynamic hand gestures. The false trigger detection algorithm effectively eliminates the false triggers, and the detection accuracy is close to 91.38%. The system uses a state machine and a linear scale algorithm to accommodate different hand gesture speed with durations ranging from 0.9s to 5.4s. Furthermore, we analyze the errors of the detection algorithm and propose a recognition architecture based on One Dimension Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) and two data collection strategies: gesture extending and gesture shifting. The proposed 1D-CNN effectively overcomes the error caused by hand gesture detection algorithm and the recognition accuracy reaches 86.91%. Combined with the gesture shifting strategy, the recognition accuracy is further improved to 93.03%.","2474-9133","978-1-7281-2373-8","10.1109/ICCW.2019.8756690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756690","","","convolutional neural nets;gesture recognition;human computer interaction;Internet of Things;wireless LAN","1D-CNN;recognition accuracy;gesture shifting strategy;WiFi signal;human-computer interaction applications;dynamic hand gesture recognition technology;gesture recognition system;RSS;dynamic hand gesture detection;multiple independent WiFi nodes;false trigger detection algorithm;recognition architecture;Internet of Things technology;received signal strength;hand gesture speed;complex dynamic hand gestures;channel state information;state machine;linear scale algorithm;one dimension convolutional neural network;gesture extending;time 0.9 s to 5.4 s","","5","","26","","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While comparing our algorithm to existing solutions, we find that the similarity between sensed Wi-Fi occupation at neighboring eNBs greatly impacts the performance of channel selection algorithms. To achieve better performance across diverse scenarios, we expand on our statistical channel selection formulation to include reinforcement learning, thereby balancing the shared contextual information with historical performance. We simulate operation in the unlicensed band using our channel selection algorithm and show how Wi-Fi load and inter-cell interference estimation can jointly be used to select transmission channels for all small cells in the network.

As location positioning gains importance for continuous interactive (CI) applications in large indoor spaces such as malls and airports, the fingerprinting databases become larger, making it computationally more difficult to position targets in real-time. On the other hand, CI applications such as Augmented Reality (AR) require low-latency positioning for a good user experience.

However, there are few researches that can keep balance between accuracy and expense, and few plans can achieve both device-free and accuracy. To solve this problem, the scheme of CSI-based autoencoder classification for Wi-Fi indoor localization is proposed. Only one wireless router and one computer are placed as signal emitter and receiver respectively. With so few ordinary devices, expenses have been decreased to a large extent. Device-free is achieved by performing localization based on Wi-Fi signal. Channel State Information (CSI) is measured and calculated to decrease the multipath effect, which reaches a higher accuracy. With the use of CSI, a mass of data are obtained. Machine learning including autoencoder and BP network are utilized owing to their advantage of processing mass data.

This paper proposes a mobile-side solution for the concurrent use of multiple radios in a performance-aware and energy-efficient manner, with which a mobile station activates and deactivates radio interfaces dynamically according to traffic demands and a predicted capacity gain. To this end, the proposed solution is composed of multiple prediction algorithms and a control algorithm. Prediction when activating an additional radio interface is relatively difficult since no information of the disabled interface's current status (and the corresponding frequency channel's) is available at the time of prediction. Our experiments show that, despite different types and used channels, different radio interfaces have a strong correlation of received signal strengths and used PHY rates between them. Based on this observation, the proposed solution learns a correlation pattern between interfaces whenever multiple interfaces are active and makes prediction of the coverage, expected PHY rate and capacity impact of an inactive interface based on the learned correlation with a currently active interface. The design of the prediction algorithms are based on a simple or machine-learning technique (SVM). The control algorithm then keeps monitoring the utilization of active interfaces and, if any of them has utilization over a threshold, checks if each inactive interface is within coverage and a valid rate range based on an active interface's received signal strength. Finally, an action of a configuration change (either activation, deactivation, or no change) selected based on the prediction of the resulting capacity is applied. Testbed experiments using COTS dual-band Wi-Fi interfaces demonstrate that the solution can enhance throughput by up to 29.6 percent (in a close distance to AP) and at most halve power consumption compared to legacy aggregation while the gain varies depending on the location and traffic conditions.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2016.2609427","National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:NRF-2014R1A1A2059515); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7567550","Link aggregation;Wi-Fi aggregation;multiple radio interfaces;multipath TCP","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Correlation;Prediction algorithms;Throughput;Power demand;Heuristic algorithms;Mobile communication","energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);power consumption;RSSI;telecommunication power management;wireless channels;wireless LAN","E-MICE;multiple Wi-Fi radio energy-efficient concurrent exploitation;individual frequency channel;mobile station communication capacity;control algorithm;multiple prediction algorithms;radio interface;received signal strength correlation;machine learning technique;SVM;COTS dual-band Wi-Fi interface;throughput enhancement","","4","","32","IEEE","14 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such inconsistent mirrored patterns are to negatively affect the uniqueness of gait and accuracy of human identification. Therefore, we propose a system called Gate-ID for accurately identifying individuals' identities irrespective of different walking directions. Gate-ID employs theoretical communication model and real measurements to demonstrate that antenna array orientations and walking directions contribute to the mirror-like patterns in WiFi signals. A novel heuristic algorithm is proposed to infer individual's walking directions. A set of methods are employed to extract and augment the representative spatial-temporal features of gait and enable the system performing irrespective of walking directions.

Although the global positioning system (GPS) is widely used for outdoor positioning, it does not provide the same accuracy in indoor environments. As a result, many alternative indoor positioning technologies have been investigated to tackle this problem during the last few years. However, most existing approaches (e.g., Camera, WiFi, and infrared-based methods) for indoor localization mainly rely on infrastructure, which is expensive and not scalable. Today, the expansion of smartphones possessing a variety of embedded sensors helped develop a precise indoor localization that can meet the requirements of location-based services. This paper proposes an indoor localization system based on magnetic field sensed via a smartphone magnetometer. Anomalies caused by the presence of ferromagnetic materials are used as signatures and fingerprinting to identify different locations. Accordingly, an Android application was developed to build a geomagnetic fingerprinting database in the corridor of Polytech Nantes, France. 7600 signatures were stored in the database, cleaned, and standardized. 70% of data is used to train and validate different multi-output regression models. Extensive simulations are conducted to find the suitable model and to tune model’s hyper-parameters. Once the model is configured and trained, remaining unseen data is used to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed system. Obtained results demonstrate that ANN is the most accurate model with Mean Absolute Error (MAE) equals 0.13m for the studied environment. Only 8% of testing samples have errors higher than the MAE. Moreover, the proposed indoor localization system can locate the user without prior knowledge of his initial position.","2643-6795","978-1-7281-9697-8","10.1109/CAMA49227.2021.9703502","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9703502","Indoor localization;magnetic field-based localization;smartphone sensors;multi-output regression;artificial neural network","Location awareness;Magnetometers;Databases;Artificial neural networks;Fingerprint recognition;Data models;Smart phones","","","","","","10","IEEE","11 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Passive WiFi sensing, by collecting WiFi probe requests sent from mobile devices, provides a better way to monitor crowds compared with people counters and cameras in terms of free interference, larger coverage, lower cost, and more information on people's movement. In the existing studies, however, not enough attention has been paid to the thorough analysis and mining of collected data. Especially, the power of machine learning has not been fully exploited. In this article, therefore, we propose a comprehensive data analysis framework to fully analyze the collected probe requests to extract three types of patterns related to crowd behaviors in a large social event, with the help of statistics, visualization, and unsupervised machine learning. First, trajectories of the mobile devices are extracted from probe requests and analyzed to reveal the spatial patterns of the crowds' movement. Hierarchical agglomerative clustering is adopted to find the interconnections between different locations. Next, k-means and k-shape clustering algorithms are applied to extract temporal visiting patterns of the crowds by days and locations, respectively. Finally, by combining with time, trajectories are transformed into spatiotemporal patterns, which reveal how trajectory duration changes over the length and how the overall trends of crowd movement change over time. The proposed data analysis framework is fully demonstrated using real-world data collected in a large social event. Results show that one can extract comprehensive patterns from data collected by a network of passive WiFi sensors.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.2972062","Singapore Urban Redevelopment Authority; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8985258","Clustering;crowd behaviors;data mining;event management;passive WiFi sensing;unsupervised learning","Probes;Wireless fidelity;Sensors;Data mining;Mobile handsets;Bluetooth;Data analysis","behavioural sciences computing;data analysis;data mining;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;social networking (online);ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN","WiFi probe requests;event management;data mining;passive WiFi sensing;crowd behavior;passive WiFi sensors;crowd movement change;mobile devices;unsupervised machine learning;social event;comprehensive data analysis framework","","15","","38","IEEE","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we propose a non-image- based people counting system based on the deep neural network (DNN) model using fine-grained physical-layer wireless signatures such as Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). Only one Wi-Fi transmitter and one laptop receiver are required, and people are not required to wear or carry any equipment (i.e., device-free).

However, it is difficult to choose the most appropriate communication mode because of the complexity of application scenario of cooperative vehicle infrastructure system. It is necessary to study multi-mode communication competition optimization method in cooperative vehicle infrastructure system.

In this paper, we utilize the network access trace and the network traffic in SEU university to profile the campus users. Here the Wi-Fi access records from wireless APs can be regarded as the mobility behaviors of users in the campus. The network traffic, which will be classified into several categories first, is quantified with the temporal dimension. With these two network datasets, we propose a Conditioned Reclassifying Algorithm based on BPNN, CRAB algorithm, to distinguish the faculty members from the students. Then the graduates and the undergraduates are identified through the binary classifying approaches. The disciplines of graduates are predicted with multi-classification approaches.

However, in the existing WiFi-based human activity recognition systems, there are the following problems: Firstly, in the processing of channel state information (CSI) data, mainly for the removal of noise in the superimposed signal, there is no effective removal of useless multipath signals; Secondly, the data segmentation algorithm based on the empirical threshold requires manual adjustment of the threshold in different environments, resulting in poor robustness and unstable segmentation; Thirdly, simple learning classification is applied without specific design for CSI data structure and sufficiently abstracting information features. In this paper, a device-free human activity recognition system with a temporal-frequency attention mechanism is proposed, which can be deployed on commercial WiFi devices to identify human's daily activities. Firstly, the multipath signal affected by the channel change is extracted by using the difference of the propagation delay of different multipath, thereby eliminating the delay and invalid multipath signals that have undergone multiple reflections and refractions. Secondly, a neural network model based on attention mechanism is proposed, which assigns different weights to different characteristics and sequences by imitating the human brain to dedicate more attention to important information. Then, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is used to learn the correlation features of different dimensions to realize human activity recognition. Finally, the system performance is evaluated in different environments, and the experimental results show that our syetem holds a better performance in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) than the existing human activity recognition systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3012021","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61771083,61704015); Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission(grant numbers:KJQN201800625); Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Project(grant numbers:cstc2019jcyj-msxmX0635); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9149596","Channel state information;multipath selection;human activity recognition;temporal-frequency attention","Activity recognition;Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Correlation","data structures;feature extraction;image motion analysis;image segmentation;neural nets;wireless LAN","data segmentation algorithm;device-free human activity recognition system;temporal-frequency attention mechanism;commercial WiFi devices;multipath signal;sequences;human brain;channel state information data;superimposed signal;WiFi-based human activity recognition systems;CSI data structure;long short-term memory model;correlation features;line-of-sight;non-line-of-sight;neural network model;empirical threshold","","8","","37","CCBY","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In through-the-wall scenario, due to the serious attenuation of signals caused by wall, the energy of target reflection signal decreases significantly and is submerged in the direct signal of the transceiver and the reflection signal of indoor static objects, making it difficult to be extracted. Therefore, the existing WiFi sensing system has some limitations in through-the-wall scene, especially in detection of the stationary human target and the number of moving human targets. According to the above problem, we propose a detection system TWMD based on multidimensional signal features in this paper. Firstly, the received Channel State Information (CSI) data is preprocessed to eliminate the phase error and amplitude noise. Then, the multidimensional features are fully extracted from the correlation coefficient matrix by using time correlation and subcarrier correlation of CSI. Finally, the mapping between features and detection results is established by Back Propagation (BP) neural network. Our experimental results show that the recognition accuracy of TWMD in the environment with glass wall, brick wall and concrete wall are above 0.980, 0.900, 0.850, respectively. Compared with the existing detection system based on single signal feature, it improves about 0.450 in the detection of the number of moving targets.","","978-1-7281-0960-2","10.1109/GCWkshps45667.2019.9024327","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9024327","","Feature extraction;Correlation;Object detection;Wireless fidelity;Neural networks;Noise reduction;Transceivers","feature extraction;indoor radio;neural nets;object detection;signal detection;wireless LAN","through-the-wall passive human target detection;broad application prospect;security monitoring;intelligent home;human-computer interaction;through-the-wall scenario;target reflection signal;direct signal;indoor static objects;through-the-wall scene;stationary human target;human targets;multidimensional signal features;multidimensional features;time correlation;glass wall;brick wall;concrete wall;single signal feature;moving targets;received channel state information;TWMD;WiFi sensing system","","1","","17","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DeepWiTraffic is a low-cost, portable, and non-intrusive solution that is built only with two WiFi transceivers. It exploits the unique WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) of passing vehicles to perform detection and classification of vehicles. Spatial and temporal correlations of CSI amplitude and phase data are identified and analyzed using a machine learning technique to classify vehicles into five different types: motorcycles, passenger vehicles, SUVs, pickup trucks, and large trucks. A large amount of CSI data and ground-truth video data are collected over a month period from a real-world two-lane rural roadway to validate the effectiveness of DeepWiTraffic. The results validate that DeepWiTraffic is an effective TMS with the average detection accuracy of 99.4% and the average classification accuracy of 91.1% in comparison with state-of-the-art non-intrusive TMSs.","2155-6814","978-1-7281-4601-0","10.1109/MASS.2019.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9077408","WiFi CSI;Traffic Monitoring System;Vehicle Classification","","learning (artificial intelligence);motorcycles;radio transceivers;road safety;road traffic;traffic engineering computing;wireless LAN","state-of-the-art nonintrusive TMSs;effective TMS;ground-truth video data;CSI data;passenger vehicles;machine learning technique;unique WiFi Channel State Information;WiFi transceivers;nonintrusive solution;TMS;huge rural road network;Intelligent Transportation Systems;deep learning;low cost WiFi-based traffic monitoring system;DeepWiTraffic","","8","","42","","27 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simply involving all the APs in location fingerprints and thus in the radio map not only wastes excessive storage but also leads to a large computational overhead. In this paper, a theoretical analysis of WiFi-based location determination is conducted to investigate the resulting localization errors and reveals that some critical APs contribute significantly more to localization than the others, implying that it is unnecessary to include every AP in localization. Consequently, a heuristic AP selection algorithm based on the error analysis is proposed to efficiently select a subset of APs for use in localization. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out by using both the UJI dataset available online and the dataset collected in our laboratory, and it is shown that the proposed algorithm not only significantly reduces the redundancy of APs in WiFi fingerprint-based localization but also substantially improves the localization accuracy of the k nearest neighbor (KNN) method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905372","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41761086,41871363,61461037,61761035); Natural Science Foundation of Inner Mongolia(grant numbers:2017JQ09); Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:CYYC5016); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669754","Indoor localization;error analysis;wireless LAN;fingerprinting","Wireless fidelity;Error analysis;Machine learning;Performance analysis;Analytical models;Feature extraction;Position measurement","error analysis;indoor radio;nearest neighbour methods;wireless LAN","k-nearest neighbor method;localization errors;localization accuracy;heuristic AP selection algorithm;WiFi-based location determination;location fingerprints;mobile device;WiFi access points;WiFi fingerprint-based localization system;offline phase;radio map;theoretical error analysis;indoor localization;critical WiFi APs","","26","","31","OAPA","19 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is therefore urgently necessary to enhance vehicle security by detecting and stopping cyber-attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised intrusion prevention system (IPS) for automotive CANs that detects and hinders attacks without modifying the architecture of the electronic control units (ECUs) or requiring information that is restricted to car manufacturers. We compare two machine learning algorithms’ ability to detect fuzzing and spoofing attacks, and evaluate which of them is most accurate with the fewest number of data bytes. The fewer data bytes required, the sooner detection can start and the sooner attacking frames can be detected. Experiment results show that our proposed detection mechanism achieves accuracy higher than 99%, F1-scores higher than 97%, and detection times shorter than <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$80 ~\mu s$ </tex-math></inline-formula> for the types of attacks considered. Moreover, when compared to four state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems, it is the only solution that is capable of discarding attacking frames before damage occurs while being deployed on inexpensive Raspberry Pi.

The propsoed model involves three main stages namely maintenence stage, automatic adaptive ON/OFF control stage and prediction of electricity consumption stage. In order to apply this technique, a Wi-Fi module, Light dependent sensor (LDR), accelerometer and ultrasonic sensors are employed. The accelerometer sensor is utilized for identifying the pole inclination and report the emergency condition to control room or user. Then, LDR sensor is employed to turn ON-OFF of street lights with respect to atmosphere intensity level. This switching could be performed using ESP8266 based on the LDR. Ultrasonic sensor helps to sense the presence of any vechicle or person in a specified range, then light glows with 100<sup>%</sup> brightness else, it is reduced and glow with only with the intensity of 60%. Besides, a predictive model based on imporved bayesian neural netwok (IBNN) model is applied. The need of IBNN model is to report the utilization of the power for a period of specific duration. The propsoed work eliminates the power wastage during night time if there is no vechicle or trespassers passing. Moreover, by applying these three sensors, an intelligent automatic light is developed using IoT frame work that is effective.","","978-1-7281-6202-7","10.1109/ICSCAN49426.2020.9262435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9262435","Street light;IoT;Arduino;Accelerometer sensor;LDR","Sensors;Internet of Things;Intelligent sensors;Predictive models;Wireless fidelity;Computational modeling;Software","accelerometers;belief networks;energy consumption;energy management systems;intelligent control;lighting control;neural nets;street lighting;ultrasonic transducers;wireless LAN","reliable smart management proposal;intelligent smart street light system;imporved Bayesian neural netwok model;intelligent automatic light;power wastage;IBNN model;ultrasonic sensor;atmosphere intensity level;LDR sensor;accelerometer sensor;ultrasonic sensors;Wi-Fi module;electricity consumption stage;control stage;modern platform","","","","9","","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Global Positioning System is a successful solution for outdoors whereas it is not suitable for indoor environments due to the lack of line of sight for radio frequency signals. Therefore, various systems have been developed to solve the indoor positioning problem. Enhancing the performance of these systems is a critical issue. Several types of measurements and classification algorithms are employed to improve the positioning performance. The aim of this work is to enhance the performance of the indoor positioning system via the integration of different features (sensor measurements) and classification algorithms. For this purpose, firstly Wi-Fi Received Signal and magnetic field sensor values are combined to construct a hybrid fingerprint map. Then, the selected classifiers including decision tree, multi-layer perceptron, and Bayesian network are integrated using majority voting method. The test results demonstrate that the ensemble of sensor measurements and classifiers outperform the other individual classification algorithms in terms of classification accuracy.

However, the performance and quality of WiFi networks are still far from satisfactory. Among many popular quality metrics (throughput, latency), the probability of successfully connecting to WiFi APs and the time cost of the WiFi connection set-up process are the two of the most critical metrics that affect WiFi users' experience. To understand the WiFi connection set-up process in real-world settings, we carry out measurement studies on 5 million mobile users from 4 representative cities associating with 7 million APs in 0.4 billion WiFi sessions, collected from a mobile “WiFi Manager” App that tops the Android/iOS App market. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do such large scale study on: how large the WiFi connection set-up time cost is, what factors affect the WiFi connection set-up process, and what can be done to reduce the WiFi connection set-up time cost. Based on our data-driven measurement and analysis, we reveal the insights as follows: (1) Connection set-up failure and large connection set-up time cost are common in today's WiFi use. As large as 45% of the users suffer connection set-up failures, and 15% (5%) of them have large connection set-up time costs over 5 seconds (10 seconds). (2) Contrary to the state-of-the-art work, scan, one of the subphase of four phases in the connection set-up process, contributes the most (47%) to the overall connection set-up time cost. (3) Mobile device model and AP model can greatly help us to predict the connection set-up time cost if we can make good use of the hidden information. Based on the measurement analysis, we develop a machine learning based AP selection strategy that can significantly improve WiFi connection set-up performance, against the conventional strategy purely based on signal strength, by reducing the connection set-up failures from 33% to 3.6% and reducing 80% time costs of the connection set-up processes by more than 10 times.","","978-1-5090-5336-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2017.8057164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8057164","","Wireless fidelity;Mobile handsets;IP networks;Authentication;Mobile communication;Switches;Measurement","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;wireless LAN","WiFi access point;WiFi networks;mobile WiFi Manager App;WiFi users experience;WiFi connection set-up process;WiFi connection set-up time cost;connection set-up failures;mobile device model;AP model;machine learning based AP selection strategy;time 5.0 s;time 10.0 s","","25","","24","","5 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the laborious continual surveys on fingerprint are inevitable. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for solving the large cost of maintaining common Wi-Fi fingerprint-based localization with machine-learning-based way by efficient incremental learning (retraining). Specifically, we propose a brand new retraining method, called GroupWi-Lo, that focuses on minimization of parameter variation with respect to the incremental surveys on fingerprint (i.e., calibration). Our method tries to keep the parameters of the previously trained model unchanged while minimizing the error on the dataset obtained in the last surveys. This formulation is helpful to keep robustness against overfitting from the limited size of the dataset per survey. The experimental results both in the lab and the uncontrolled environment show that GroupWi-Lo achieves competitive performance among the state-of-the-art methods, while its computational cost retains independent of the number of surveys compared with existing the semi-supervised approach and standard incremental training approach.","2471-917X","978-1-7281-1788-1","10.1109/IPIN.2019.8911754","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8911754","Wi-Fi fingerprinting;machine-learning-based indoor localization;total variation;model maintaining","Computational modeling;Training;Data models;Calibration;Standards;Wireless fidelity;Computational efficiency","indoor navigation;indoor radio;wireless LAN","standard incremental training approach;semi-supervised approach;incremental learning;Wi-Fi fingerprint-based localization;Wi-Fi-based indoor localization accurate;indoor positioning technology;group-wise total variation regularization;Group Wi-Lo","","3","","39","","28 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Machine learning (ML) techniques are widely adopted along with the rapidly growing amount of data. However, during training, almost none of ML techniques incorporate the known structural information such as floor plan, which can be especially useful in indoor or other structured environments. The problem is incredibly hard because the structural properties are not explicitly available, making most structural learning approaches inapplicable. We study our method through the intuitions from manifold learning.

Clients' native decisions that tend to prefer 5 GHz will consequently cause serious interference in 5 GHz and leave 2.4 GHz notably idle. Through analyzing a unique dataset in the wild, we quantitatively study the impact of various WiFi factors on the wireless delay.

The predicted use cases are many and varied, and include navigation, planning, advertising and communication. Potentially, indoor tracking could become as ubiquitous as GPS - however, all of these possibilities depend on being able to produce a reasonably accurate, reliable system which does not require specialised infrastructure. While professional systems using custom devices are able to achieve very high levels of accuracy (<;1 cm), consumer no-infrastructure systems struggle to achieve reliable room-level tracking. This paper focuses on the use of WiFi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting, a machine learning approach which currently seems to be the most promising option for consumer smartphones. We have undertaken experimentation and optimisation in a real-world, noisy environment - the Ian Potter Museum of Art - where we developed and deployed a no-infrastructure, indoor visitor tracking application. Data was collected in a trial involving several dozen users over a few weeks, who used the system extensively. This data was analysed with a range of current WiFi RSSI fingerprinting techniques and algorithms (WASP, Redpin (kNN), SSD, SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes and Random Forests), and their efficacy was compared and improved where possible. Known challenges such as device heterogeneity are explored, and the consistency of signal levels, including magnetic fields, are examined. Large Random Forests (200 trees) were found to have the best performance, which was further improved by calibrating for average differences in RSSI between phone models, to achieve an average of 90% correct classification of exhibits within the top five hits.","","978-1-4673-8054-6","10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275486","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275486","wifi;fingerprinting;optimisation;machine learning","Base stations;Reliability;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Support vector machines;Indoor navigation;Wireless communication","fingerprint identification;Global Positioning System;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence)","indoor location recognition;wireless fingerprinting;Ian Potter Museum of Art;indoor tracking;smartphones adds context;navigation;planning;advertising;communication;GPS;WiFi;received signal strength indicator;RSSI;machine learning;WASP;Redpin;SSD;SVM;Gaussian Naive Bayes","","8","","14","","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the varying network conditions could also lead to the video client running out of the playback content resulting in rebuffering events. These factors affect the user satisfaction and cause degradation of the user quality of experience (QoE). Hence, it is important to quantify the perceptual QoE of the streaming video users and to monitor the same in a continuous manner so that the QoE degradation can be minimized. However, the continuous evaluation of QoE is challenging as it is determined by complex dynamic interactions among the QoE influencing factors. Toward this end, we present long short-term memory (LSTM)-QoE, a recurrent neural network-based QoE prediction model using an LSTM network. The LSTM-QoE is a network of cascaded LSTM blocks to capture the nonlinearities and the complex temporal dependencies involved in the time-varying QoE. Based on an evaluation over several publicly available continuous QoE datasets, we demonstrate that the LSTM-QoE has the capability to model the QoE dynamics effectively. We compare the proposed model with the state-of-the-art QoE prediction models and show that it provides an excellent performance across these datasets.

The existing works either provide room-level or latitude-longitude prediction instead of a hybrid solution, catering only to specific application needs. This paper proposes a new infrastructure-less, indoor localization system named HybLoc using Wi-Fi fingerprints. The system employs Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based soft clustering and Random Decision Forest (RDF) ensembles for hybrid indoor localization i.e., both room-level and latitude-longitude prediction. GMM-based soft clustering allows finding natural data subsets helping cascaded classifiers better learn underlying data dynamics. The RDF ensembles enhance the capabilities of decision trees providing better generalization. A publically available Wi-Fi fingerprints data set UJIIndoorLoc (multi-floor and multi-building) has been used for experimental evaluation. The results describe the potential of HybLoc to provide the hybrid location of user viz a viz the reported literature for both levels of prediction. For room estimation, HybLoc has demonstrated mean 85% accuracy, 89% precision as compared with frequently used k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based approaches with 56% accuracy, 60% precision and 42% accuracy, 48% precision, respectively, averaged over all buildings. We also compared HybLoc performance with baseline Random Forest providing 79% accuracy and 82% precision which clearly demonstrates the enhanced performance by HybLoc. In terms of latitude-longitude prediction, HybLoc, kNN, ANN, and baseline Random Forest had 6.29 m, 8.1 m, 180.7 m, and 10.2 m mean error over complete data set.

Previous research usually exploits several distribution features from a long time series (hundreds of samples) of WiFi received signal strength (RSS) or WiFi round-trip time (RTT) to achieve a high identification accuracy. However, the long time series or large sample size attributes to high power and time consumption in data collection for both training and testing. This will also undoubtedly be detrimental to user experience as the waiting time for getting enough samples is quite long. Therefore, this paper proposes three new real-time NLOS/LOS identification methods for smartphone-based indoor positioning systems using WiFi RSS and RTT distance measurement (RDM). Based on our extensive analysis of RSS and RDM dispersion features, three machine learning algorithms were chosen and developed to separate the samples for NLOS/LOS conditions. Experiments show that our best method achieves a discrimination accuracy of over 96% with a sample size of 10. Considering the theoretically shortest WiFi ranging interval of 100ms of the RTT-enabled smartphones, our algorithm is able to provide the shortest latency of 1s to get the testing result among all of the state-of-art methods.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3119234","University of Edinburgh; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9565917","Real-time NLOS identification;WiFi RTT;WiFi RSS;machine learning;smartphone;positioning","Wireless fidelity;Distance measurement;Smart phones;Feature extraction;Real-time systems;Testing;Dispersion","","","","","","31","IEEE","8 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The offline radio map needs frequent maintenance if the data get faulted or need update due to the changes in indoor surroundings. This paper studies the effect of spatial correlation in the densely collected Wi-Fi measurements to enhanced the positioning accuracy. The K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and inverse distance weight (IDW) algorithms were implemented to interpolate the incomplete Wi-Fi radio map.

WiFi network is one of the main ways for smart devices to access the network. Compared with using cellular network, users are more willing to connect to WiFi when there is WiFi coverage, and even automatically crack the WiFi password to connect. In order to improve the access security of WiFi devices, this paper proposes an Authentication method for WiFi connection of device based on Channel State Information (CSI). The method can effectively prevent illegal users from connecting WiFi outside the legal area. When devices are connected to WiFi in different locations, it will cause different changes in CSI. According to this feature, a fingerprint database is established in each area within the WiFi signal range. Hampel filter is used to remove the noise caused by environmental factors in CSI data stream. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to filter the non-limited locations. However, WiFi authentication has a strong real-time requirement. SVM algorithm which only uses cross-validation to select parameters can not quickly find the appropriate parameters to adapt to the current environment. To solve the above problems, Percentile algorithm is used to improve the efficiency of RBF kernel function parameter selection, which significantly improves the real-time performance of authentication methods. The experimental results show that the accuracy of correct authentication can reach about 95%.","","978-1-7281-8635-1","10.1109/ICCC51575.2020.9345065","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702354,61876121); Suzhou University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:XKZ2017004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9345065","WiFi;channel State Information;authentication;indoor location","Support vector machines;Authentication;Filtering algorithms;Real-time systems;Wireless fidelity;Channel state information;Password","message authentication;mobile computing;radial basis function networks;support vector machines;wireless LAN","information services;intelligent mobile devices;authentication methods;WiFi authentication;CSI data stream;WiFi signal range;illegal users;Channel State Information;Authentication method;WiFi devices;access security;WiFi password;WiFi coverage;cellular network;smart devices;WiFi network;communication networks","","","","19","","12 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yoo","Department of Electrical, Electronic and Control Engineering, Hankyong National University, Anseoung, South Korea","IEEE Sensors Journal","10 Feb 2020","2020","20","5","2608","2615","A set of Wi-Fi RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) measurements is one of basic sensory observation available for indoor localization. One major drawback of the RSSI based localization is maintenance of the RSSI fingerprint database, which should be periodically updated against measurement pattern changes caused by relocation, removal and malfunction of Wi-Fi APs (access points). To address this problem, a new change detection method is proposed in this paper. First, by machine learning techniques, the RSSI database is reconstructed to a probabilistic feature database by the implementations of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and GP (Gaussian Process). Then, KL (Kullback-Leibler) divergence is used as a metric to measure the similarity of the existing database and a newly arrived test sets. The proposed method is evaluated by a real experiment at a multi-storey building. For experimental study, different cases that provoke changes of RSSI patterns are considered, and the positioning accuracy is examined by the k-NN (Nearest Neighbor) method. From the experimental results, it is found that the bigger the RSSI pattern changes, the large the KL divergences become. Also, when a modified change detection algorithm as the benchmark, which does not implement the PCA feature extraction, is compared, the proposed algorithm yields accurate and fast computing performances. In addition, the required number of survey points is empirically found associated with the threshold value to trigger the detection alarm.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2019.2951712","National Research Foundation of Korea; National Research Foundation of Korea(grant numbers:2019R1F1A1057516); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891674","Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprint;indoor localization;feature extraction;machine learning;Gaussian process;KL divergence","Databases;Principal component analysis;Wireless fidelity;Feature extraction;Probabilistic logic;Detection algorithms;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","feature extraction;Gaussian processes;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);principal component analysis;RSSI;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","PCA feature extraction;detection alarm;Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator measurements;modified change detection algorithm;RSSI pattern changes;k-NN method;positioning accuracy;RSSI patterns;multistorey building;Kullback-Leibler divergence;KL divergence;Gaussian Process;Principal Component Analysis;probabilistic feature database;RSSI database;machine learning techniques;change detection method;access points;Wi-Fi APs;measurement pattern changes;RSSI fingerprint database;RSSI based localization;indoor localization;basic sensory observation;Wi-Fi RSSI measurements;indoor positioning system;RSSI fingerprint pattern","","8","","36","CCBY","5 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Three wireless sensor nodes are used to capture 3-axis human thermal image. Totally, 15063 samples are collected from four volunteers while they had performed eight human postures as the ground truth for the 10-fold cross-validation of DCNN models. Experimental results indicate that the highest average F1-score for the eight postures was 0.9981.

However, their services can still be improved for a better quality of life. In this paper, we aim to determine the exact location of a smartphone in a room, i.e, on a study desk, a television table, etc. By this way, our daily settings may be automatically activated from the smartphone itself. For example, if a user puts his/her phone on the bed commode, then the phone would be able to switch itself to the night mode on its own. A successful localization in a room should be able to distinguish different corners from each other so that it can be used in various applications as a supported technology. Hence, in this work, we are proposing an indoor localization system that can distinguish different indoor places by using the smartphones' sensors and Wi-Fi services. Unlike the common location-based services, our solution is not a server-client based system. In order to enhance feasibility and availability, we only use the mobile device but no additional infrastructure. We developed two applications on Android platform. The first one allows the user to easily collect sensor data from his/her living places, such as home and office settings. The second one is a data mining application sourced by Weka.

Hence, in this work, another important dimension to indoor comfort is introduced-Wi-Fi comfort. A novel comfort management architecture is proposed which employs machine learning to recognize the level of Wi-Fi comfort. The proposed architecture complements the extensive research done in the area of network planning, by providing Quality of Experience (QoE) of Wi-Fi as an effective input to such mechanisms. Comfort is predicted based on the Wi-Fi signal strength, Wi-Fi access permissions, steady-state occupancy and applications used by the occupants. A case study is presented in which occupants use a specific set of applications, such as email, voice and/or video for a given duration.

Due to the complex relationship between human activities and WiFi CSI measurements, the accuracies of current recognition systems are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning based approach, i.e., attention based bi-directional long short-term memory (ABLSTM), for passive human activity recognition using WiFi CSI signals. The BLSTM is employed to learn representative features in two directions from raw sequential CSI measurements. Since the learned features may have different contributions for final activity recognition, we leverage on an attention mechanism to assign different weights for all the learned features. Real experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed ABLSTM for human activity recognition.

The provided capacity surge makes it one of the most high-profile technologies to meet the explosive growth of mobile traffic demand. Among its different variants, Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) is considered as a promising global solution attributed to its mandatory listen-before-talk (LBT) procedure. Nevertheless, although LBT effectively maintains transmission fairness between LTE and other unlicensed systems (e.g., Wi-Fi), the current LAA protocol specified in 3GPP Release 13 is far from perfect to achieve harmony coexistence. To this end, in this paper, we first develop an analytical model to evaluate the throughput performance of Category 4 (Cat 4) algorithm agreed in 3GPP release 13. Subject to the system fairness constraint, the aggregate throughput of LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi networks is maximized based on a semi branch and bound algorithm. To make the complex optimization tractable, reinforcement learning techniques are introduced to intelligently tune the contention window size for both LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi nodes. Specifically, a cooperative learning algorithm is developed assuming that the information between different systems is exchangeable. A non-cooperative version is subsequently developed to remove the previous assumption for better practicability. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed learning algorithms in contrast to the analytical upper bound under various conditions. It is shown that both proposed learning algorithms can significantly improve the total throughput performance while satisfying the fairness constraints. Particularly, the proposed cooperative learning algorithm can closely approach the analytical bound.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2994525","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-1554576,CNS-1816908,ECCS-1610874); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9093212","Licensed-assisted-access;unlicensed band;performance analysis;reinforcement learning","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Cats;Throughput;Machine learning;Heuristic algorithms;Learning (artificial intelligence)","3G mobile communication;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;mobile computing;optimisation;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi nodes;cooperative learning algorithm;fairness constraints;fair coexistence;LTE-LAA;Long-Term Evolution;LTE technology;spacious unlicensed spectrum;high-profile technologies;mobile traffic demand;Licensed Assisted Access;listen-before-talk procedure;LBT;transmission fairness;unlicensed systems;LAA protocol;3GPP Release 13;Category 4 algorithm;3GPP release 13;system fairness constraint;Wi-Fi networks;reinforcement learning techniques;capacity surge","","8","","37","IEEE","13 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the proposed learning approach, D2D-U links can optimally select the time fraction on unlicensed channels without knowing the accurate WiFi traffic in a dynamic WiFi working environment. To address the state space explosion during the learning process, the Deep Q-learning network (DQN) is adopted by combining a deep neural network (DNN) with the traditional Q-learning mechanism.

We present an approach to estimate the interference between nodes and links in a live wireless network by passive monitoring of wireless traffic. This does not require any controlled experiments, injection of probe traffic in the network, or even access to the network nodes. Our approach requires deploying multiple sniffers across the network to capture wireless traffic traces. These traces are then analyzed to infer the interference relations between nodes and links. We model the 802.11 MAC as a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and use a machine learning approach to learn the state transition probabilities in this model using the observed trace. This coupled with an estimation of collision probabilities helps us to deduce the interference relationships. We show the effectiveness of this method against simpler heuristics, and also a profiling-based method that requires active measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly more accurate than heuristics and quite competitive with active measurements. We also validate the approach in a real WLAN environment.","2155-5494","978-1-4244-7151-5","10.1109/SECON.2010.5508290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5508290","","Interference;Hidden Markov models;Communication system traffic control;Wireless networks;Traffic control;Degradation;Monitoring;Probes;Machine learning;Wireless LAN","access protocols;hidden Markov models;interference (signal);learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","interference relation deconstruction;WiFi networks;wireless interference;802.11 wireless networks;wireless traffic monitoring;802.11 MAC;hidden Markov model;machine learning;state transition probabilities;collision probabilities;profiling-based method","","13","","23","","12 Jul 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework relies on the fact that the state - ON or OFF - of some home appliances causes detectable changes in the characteristics of the wireless channel. For proof of concept demonstrations, we select a number of home appliances whose operation is either characterized by moving parts or by generation of radio frequency interference (RFI) - properties which we show can be detected by analysing reflected radio frequency energy in the wireless channel. Using software-defined radios with a WiFi-like physical layer, we develop a prototype system for the detection of the following home appliances: (a) Ceiling Fan, (b) Pedestal Fan, (c) Washing Machine, and (d) Microwave Oven. We identify relevant features on the measured Channel State Information (CSI) that depict the environmental changes due to state of different home appliances. These features are used by a subsequent machine learning stage to classify the state and type of the home appliance.

Wi-Fi signals can provide rough initial positions, and magnetic fields can further improve the positioning accuracies, therefore many researchers have tried to combine the two signals for high-accuracy indoor localization. Currently, state-of-the-art solutions design separate algorithms to process different indoor signals. Outputs of these algorithms are generally used as inputs of data fusion strategies. These methods rely on computationally expensive particle filters, labor-intensive feature analysis, and time-consuming parameter tuning to achieve better accuracies. Besides, particle filters need to estimate the moving directions of particles, limiting smartphone orientation to be stable, and aligned with the user's moving directions. In this paper, we adopted a convolutional neural network (CNN) to implement an accurate and orientation-free positioning system. Inspired by the state-of-the-art image classification methods, we design a novel hybrid location image using Wi-Fi and magnetic field fingerprints, and then a CNN is employed to classify the locations of the fingerprint images. In order to prevent the overfitting problem of the positioning CNN on limited training datasets, we also propose to divide the learning process into two steps to adopt proper learning strategies for different network branches. We show that the CNN solution is able to automatically learn location patterns, thus significantly lower the workforce burden of designing a localization system. Our experimental results convincingly reveal that the proposed positioning method achieves an accuracy of about 1 m under different smartphone orientations, users, and use patterns.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2884193","National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)(grant numbers:2018YFB0505200); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872046); BUPT Excellent Ph.D. Students Foundation(grant numbers:CX2017404); Open Project of the Beijing Key Laboratory of Mobile Computing and Pervasive Device; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8554268","Indoor positioning;indoor localization;neural networks;fingerprint;feature extraction","Wireless fidelity;Magnetic fields;Fingerprint recognition;Training;Probabilistic logic;Image matching","convolutional neural nets;Global Positioning System;image classification;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);smart phones;wireless LAN","solution design separate algorithms;localization pattern system;positioning CNN solution;hybrid location image classification methods;orientation-free positioning system;indoor signals;indoor localization;deep learning strategies;fingerprint imaging;time-consuming parameter tuning;labor-intensive feature analysis;data fusion strategies;magnetic fields;rough initial positions;Wi-Fi signals;location-related features;indoor positioning researches;magnetic field fingerprinting;magnetic field fingerprints;convolutional neural network;smartphone orientation;particle filters","","51","","47","OAPA","30 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With every passing day, deep learning based methods are applied to solve new problems with exceptional results. The portal to the real world is the edge. The true impact of AI can only be fully realized if we can have AI agents continuously interacting with the real world and solving everyday problems. Unfortunately, high compute and memory requirements of DNNs acts a huge barrier towards this vision. Today we circumvent this problem by deploying special purpose inference hardware on the edge while procuring trained models from the cloud. This approach, however, relies on constant interaction with the cloud for transmitting all the data, training on massive GPU clusters, and downloading updated models. This is challenging for bandwidth, privacy, and constant connectivity concerns that autonomous agents may exhibit. In this paper we evaluate techniques for enabling adaptive intelligence on edge devices with zero interaction with any high-end cloud/server. We build a prototype distributed system of Raspberry Pis communicating via WiFi running NeuroEvolutionary (NE) learning and inference. We evaluate the performance of such a collaborative system and detail the compute/communication characteristics of different arrangements of the system that trade-off parallelism versus communication. Using insights from our analysis, we also propose algorithmic modifications to reduce communication by up to 3.6x during the learning phase to enhance scalability even further and match performance of higher end computing devices at scale.

This requirement is essential and the MIMO system that we have designed using MB-OFDM also needs to work in an environment in which systems like Wi-Fi, WiMAX, etc. also works. To achieve this, we have focused on use of Active Interference cancellation techniques for MIMO systems to reduce the need for a predetermined interference calculation that is absolute and cannot be changed on short notice or be varied with respect to the prevailing environmental conditions on a real time basis. The choice of MIMO system is to achieve high data rate in short range communication. Moreover, the improvement in the notch depth is still enriched by the proposed method. The main advantage for the improving of notch depth is that it reduces the side lobes there by concentrating the power to the main lobe. This increases the efficiency of the communication network and also reduces the interference. A neural network is a tool that is able to predict an output when it recognizes a given input pattern. In this paper neural network is used to train the system for the desired output and the expected goal is reached. Back propagation algorithm is used to train the system.

This paper is dedicated to addressing two critical problems: a) signal fluctuation due to unforeseeable interferences during the offline training phase; b) insufficient real-time signal measurements at certain point due to the target movement during the online localization phase. Specifically, we first give an intensive analysis on the characteristics of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) in indoor environments with respect to both time-domain and frequency-domain. Then, inspired from the advantages of Stacked Denosing Autoencoder (SDA) in terms of recognizing and stabilizing the original features, we propose a dual-band SDA (DBSDA) based model to create more distinguishable fingerprints by extracting the RSSI features at each reference point (RP). In this model, both 2.4GHz and 5GHz RSSIs are exploited to train the SDA neural network and construct the offline fingerprint database. On this basis, we propose a data generation scheme, which is designed based on the observation that environmental interferences are similar in proximate spots. So, the designed scheme can generate signal values at certain point based on its nearby RSSI measurements when there are not enough inputs for the SDA neural network. Finally, we propose a locally weighted liner regression (LWLR) based method to predict the coordinate of the target. For performance evaluation, we implement the system prototype and give comprehensive experiments in real-world environments, which demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed solutions.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013872","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013872","","Dual band;Databases;Wireless fidelity;Training;Frequency-domain analysis;Phase measurement;Feature extraction","indoor radio;neural nets;radiofrequency interference;regression analysis;RSSI;signal denoising;wireless LAN","SDA neural network;offline fingerprint database;data generation scheme;environmental interferences;signal values;nearby RSSI measurements;location-based services;signal fluctuation;unforeseeable interferences;offline training phase;target movement;online localization phase;received signal strength indicator;indoor environments;time-domain;frequency-domain;dual-band SDA based model;distinguishable fingerprints;RSSI features;stacked denosing autoencoder;locally weighted linear regression based method;dual-band Wi-Fi based indoor localization;frequency 5.0 GHz;frequency 2.4 GHz","","3","","16","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Location detection in outdoor places GPS-enabled devices and signals from at least 3 different satellites are easy to implement due to various difficulties (such as forested areas, high-rise buildings). On the other hand, In indoor places like hospital, airports, car parks, mines; Wi-Fi, Beacon and Radio Frequency (RF) signals are used for position detection. In this study, on a sample data set consisting of signals from 7 different access points in a closed area, analyzes were made by using machine learning algorithms on the correct position determination. With the obtained values and the comparisons made, it was seen that the location could be determined by using the access point signals in the indoor. In this pre - study, it is aimed to reduce adverse conditions with rapid and high accuracy location detection in emergency situations which may occur in hospital buildings where time is crucial.","","978-1-7281-1013-4","10.1109/EBBT.2019.8741769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8741769","data mining;classification;naive bayes;k nearest neighbor;indoor location detection.","Global Positioning System;Wireless fidelity;Wireless communication;Hospitals;Data mining;Support vector machines","indoor navigation;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;multi-access systems;radionavigation;signal classification;signal detection;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi Signals;hospital indoor location detection;classification algorithms;forested areas;high-rise buildings;indoor places;car parks;Radio Frequency signals;position detection;access point signals;hospital buildings;GPS-enabled devices;position determination;location detection;RF signals;beacon signals;machine learning algorithms","","","","","","20 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When providing an LBS for the latter, motion models and the information provided from motion sensors are commonly used to reduce the error in the localization, but this information is not always available. In this paper, we propose an approach to estimate the position of a moving device using a topological radio-map designed for static WiFi localization in a previous work. This approach uses a Bayes filter that continuously estimates the most likely position of the device. This filter will have to deal with the low working frequency of the device and the uncertainty of the observation to provide an accurate and fast estimation.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) that do not rely on handcrafting features have proven to be remarkably effective in fingerprinting tasks, as long as the channel remains invariant. However, DNNs trained at a specific location and time perform poorly on datasets collected under different channel conditions. This article proposes a data augmentation step within the training pipeline that exposes the DNN to many simulated channel and noise variations that are not present in the original dataset. We describe two approaches for data augmentation. The first approach is applied to the ""transmitter data"" when transmitter side data (i.e., pure signals without channel distortion) is available. The second approach is applied to the ""receiver data"" when only a passive dataset is available with already over-the-air transmitted signals. We show that data augmentation results in 75 percent improvement in the former case with a custom-generated dataset, and around 32-51 percent improvement in the latter case on a 5000-device WiFi dataset, compared to the case of non-augmented data fed to DNNs.","1558-1896","","10.1109/MCOM.001.2000180","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9247526","","Training;Radio frequency;Neural networks;Radio transmitters;Wireless communication;Receivers;Wireless fidelity","neural nets;radio transmitters;telecommunication computing;wireless channels;wireless LAN","wireless signal;deep neural networks;channel-resilient RF fingerprinting data augmentation;transmitter-imposed variation;DNN;over-the-air transmitted signal;WiFi dataset","","10","","13","","3 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

This diminishes the performance of deep learning classifiers deployed in the field because they cannot accurately identify signals from classes outside of the training set. In this paper, a convolution neural network based open set classifier is proposed with the ability to detect signal that are not from known classes by thresholding the output sigmoid activation.

The closed set classifier achieves an average accuracy of 94.5% for known signals with SNR's greater than 0 dB, but by design, the closed set classifier cannot detect signals from unknown classes.

Due to the complexity of the indoor environment, fingerprint positioning methods have better performance than the methods based on propagation models. In the WiFi network, the received signal strength (RSS) is usually used as the fingerprint feature. Due to the influence of noise in the environment, there is the error between the fingerprint information and the online data, which results in deviation of the localization results. We proposed a novel noise reduction fingerprint feature which calculates the difference of RSS at the same location and combines it with the original RSS and then obtains the fingerprint feature through the principal component analysis, which can improve the robustness of the Wi-Fi signal and reduce the influence of the environmental noise. In order to valid the performance of the proposed fingerprint feature, we introduced the recurrent neural network based indoor localization algorithm. The algorithm takes the correlation of historical locations into consideration and establish the relationship between the characteristics of the wireless signal and location by recurrent neural network.

In the conventional work on Wi-Fi CSI based fall detection, a classification performance degradation has been observed when data in different environments is used for learning and testing data. Also, that method can not capture accurate features of motion due to the signal distortion during the noise reduction, and it can not segment signals accurately when the SNR (Signal to Noise power Ratio) is small. In this paper, we propose a spectrogram image-based fall detection using Wi-Fi CSI. Unlike the conventional method, CSI is segmented with a certain sliding time window, and then the classifier detects fall by using the spectrogram image generated from segmented CSI. We use a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for binary classification of the spectrogram images of the fall and non-fall motions. We carried out experiments to evaluate the classification performance of our proposed method against the conventional one by using motion data in two different rooms for learning and testing data. As a result, we confirmed that our proposed method outperformed conventional one and reached 0.90 accuracy.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322323","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322323","","Spectrogram;Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Fall detection;Motion segmentation;Image segmentation;Data mining","convolutional neural nets;fall detection;feature extraction;geriatrics;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;wireless LAN","spectrogram analysis;learning testing data;segment signals;spectrogram image-based fall detection;segmented CSI;nonfall motions;Wi-Fi-CSI-based fall detection;CNN;channel state information;SNR;signal to noise power ratio;convolutional neural network;binary classification","","1","","19","","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the current methods suffer from performance degradation caused by small samples and environment or target change. To solve these problems, we propose a GAN-based WiFi action recognition method, WiARGAN. First, WiARGAN leverages GAN to generate and expand data to increase the diversity of samples. Second, to improve the performance of the model in the case of small samples and target change, a small amount of unlabeled data from new user is selected to participate in semi-supervised training. Finally, to avoid sparse gradients, the generator uses SoftPlus as activation function instead of ReLU, and regularization is added to make WiARGAN more stable and avoid overfitting. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that the recognition accuracy of WiARGAN is achieved 98.54% and 95.83%, respectively, which improves significantly compared to the state-of-the-art methods.","","978-1-6654-1236-0","10.1109/SWC50871.2021.00018","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604410","channel state information (CSI);generate adversarial networks (GANs);action recognition;WiFi","Training;Performance evaluation;Degradation;Technological innovation;Privacy;Smart cities;Generative adversarial networks","image motion analysis;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;wireless LAN","GANs;WiFi-based action recognition technology;device-free;strong privacy;performance degradation;target change;GAN-based;WiARGAN leverages GAN;unlabeled data;recognition accuracy;WiFi-based action recognition method","","","","29","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The user's device will be able to connect to the network using 5G and other technologies such as LTE, WiMAX, WiFi, Satellite, etc. Satellite Communication (SatCOM), on the other hand, has been proposed as a network of choice to supplement the 5G use cases. In most of 5G's use cases, satellite communication would provide a complimentary service for global coverage, critical communication, broadcast/multicast provision, and multimedia traffic growth. Hence, for these connections to operate effectively, a smooth transmission between 5G and satellite is needed. However, in a heterogeneous wireless network, a major issue is determining how to assign a user to the best Radio Access Technology (RAT). An intelligent hybrid RAT selection algorithm based on machine learning is proposed in this paper. The User Terminal is trained to select the necessary RAT to admit its call using the Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Algorithm. Based on the simulation results, the proposed algorithm has the ability to learn in a competent way to successfully manage resource management autonomously and therefore increases the user's quality of service (QoS). The algorithm also showed better expected total reward, lower call blocking probability and higher throughput when compared with a Markov Reward-Based Greedy Algorithm.","","978-1-6654-3888-9","10.1109/MysuruCon52639.2021.9641666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9641666","5G Network;Satellite Network;RAT Selection;Heterogeneous Wireless Network;Machine Learning;Reinforcement Learning;Actor-Critic Algorithm","Greedy algorithms;Machine learning algorithms;5G mobile communication;Simulation;Satellite broadcasting;Quality of service;Reinforcement learning","","","","","","27","","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of the cutting-edge WiFi-based localization techniques exploits time-reversal resonating strength (TRRS) of coherent channel frequency responses (CFR). The basic concept of CFR-based positioning is based on the similarity measure between the testing CFR and the pre-recorded CFR fingerprints. A common assumption in previous works is that the wireless channel is time invariant. In this paper, we study CFR-based positioning in a dynamic indoor environment. Using the collected channel response fingerprints for both LOS and NLOS scenarios, we exploit supervised machine learning techniques to enhance the processing speed while achieving high positioning accuracy under the effect of dynamic wireless channels.","2155-5494","978-1-5386-5241-1","10.1109/SECONW.2018.8396358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8396358","","Testing;Support vector machines;Training;IP networks;Wireless communication;Training data;Wireless fidelity","frequency response;indoor navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);wireless channels;wireless LAN","machine learning techniques;channel frequency response;indoor positioning;dynamic environments;signal strength;nonline-of-sight situations;NLOS;mobile devices;infrastructure indoors;cutting-edge WiFi-based localization techniques;time-reversal resonating strength;coherent channel frequency responses;CFR-based;pre-recorded CFR fingerprints;wireless channel;high positioning accuracy;dynamic wireless channels","","3","","10","","28 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ZIL uses ZigBee interfaces to collect mixed WiFi signals, which include non-periodic WiFi data and periodic beacon signals. However, WiFi APs cannot be identified from these WiFi signals by ZigBee interfaces directly. To address this issue, we propose a method for detecting WiFi APs to form WiFi fingerprints from the signals collected by ZigBee interfaces. We propose a novel fingerprint matching algorithm to align a pair of fingerprints effectively. To improve the localization accuracy, we design the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) method with three different weighted distances and find that the KNN algorithm with the Manhattan distance performs best.

Wider channel, unfortunately, increases the probability of partial channel overlap, and thus introduces more adjacent channel interference (ACI) than ever. Prior work either tries to avoid ACI, or neglects it in a brute-force way. In this paper, we carefully investigate the interference pattern at physical layer (PHY), and propose interference randomization (InterRandom) to strategically harness ACI for simultaneous transmission. The key insight behind InterRandom is to randomize the interference according to the overlapped ratio, and utilize coding redundancy to recover the corrupted data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of InterRandom, we further propose an InterRandom-enabled Media Access Control layer (MAC) protocol to facilitate Wi-Fi infrastructure mode transmission. We verify the feasibility of InterRandom on GNU radio testbed.

There are billions of devices and millions of access points (APs), but only very few non-overlapping channels. As a result, the performance of Wi-Fi devices is severely degraded, because perfect channel allocation - with every AP alone in its channel - is close to impossible. Even in situations where all networks are under centralised control, existing approaches quickly tend to be either unscalable or suboptimal. By focusing on a subset of problems, identifying Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) that severely interfere with each other, performance can be improved even in such a complex situation. We tackle this problem through machine learning and coin it Bad Neighbour Detection (BND). Based on this output alongside monitoring data about the networks' activity, we then propose a channel allocation that optimises performance and as a side effect, stabilises networks that we do not control.

Even though kNN is one of the most used classification methods due to its high precision results, it lacks scalability since an instance we need to classify must be compared to all other instances in the training base. In this work, we use a novel hierarchical navigable small world graph technique to fit the training database so that the samples can be efficiently classified in the online phase of the fingerprint positioning, allowing it to be used in large-scale scenarios and/or to be executed in resource-limited devices. We evaluated the performance of this solution using both synthetic and real-world training data and compared its performance to other known kNN variants such as kd-tree and ball-tree.

This paper proposes an algorithm for the automatic construction of environmental fingerprints on multi-storey buildings, leveraging the information sources available in each scenario. It relies on unlabelled crowdsourced data from users’ smartphones. With only the floor plans as input, a demand for most applications, we apply a multimodal approach that joins inertial data, local magnetic field and Wi-Fi signals to construct highly accurate fingerprints. Precise movement estimation is achieved regardless of smartphone usage through Deep Neural Networks, and the transition between floors detected from barometric data. Users’ trajectories obtained with Pedestrian Dead Reckoning techniques are partitioned into clusters with Wi-Fi measurements. Straight sections from the same cluster are then compared with subsequence Dynamic Time Warping to search for similarities. From the identified overlapping sections, a particle filter fits each trajectory into the building’s floor plans. From all successfully mapped routes, fingerprints labelled with physical locations are finally obtained.

In particular, techniques that exploit cheap inertial measurement units (IMU), the gyroscope and the accelerometer, have garnered attention, especially in an embedded computing context. However, these sensors measurements are quite unreliable, and it is widely believed that these sensors by themselves are too noisy for localization with acceptable accuracy. Consequently, several lines of work embody other costly alternatives to lower the impact of accumulated errors associated with IMU based approaches, invariably leading to very high energy costs resulting in lowered battery life. In this paper, we show that IMUs are sufficient by themselves if we augment them with known structural or geographical information about the physical area being explored by the user. By using the map of the region being explored and the fact that humans typically walk in a structured manner, our approach sidesteps the challenges created by noise and concomitant accumulation of error. Specifically, we show that a simple coarse-grained machine learning approach mitigates the effect of the noisy perturbations in the information from our IMUs, provided we have accurate maps. Throughout, we rely on the principle of inexactness in an overarching manner and relax the need for absolute accuracy in return for significant lowering of resource (energy) costs. Notably, our approach is completely independent of any external guidance from sources including GPS, Bluetooth or WiFi support, and is this privacy preserving. Specifically, we show through experimental results that by relying on gyroscope and accelerometer data alone, we can correctly identify the path-segment where the user is walking/running on a known map, as well as the position within the path with an accuracy of 4.3 meters on the average using 0.44 Joules. This is a factor of 27X cheaper in energy lower than the “gold standard” that one could consider based on GPS support which, surprisingly, has an associated error of 8.7 meters on the average.","1558-1101","978-3-9815370-8-6","10.23919/DATE.2017.7927040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7927040","","Estimation;Global Positioning System;Gyroscopes;Sensors;Noise measurement;Accelerometers","Bluetooth;geographic information systems;Global Positioning System;inertial navigation;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","location detection;IMUs;coarse-grained machine learning;inertial measurement units;gyroscope;accelerometer;embedded computing context;sensor measurements;energy costs;geographical information;noisy perturbation effect;resource costs;GPS;WiFi support;Bluetooth;path-segment identification;navigation technology;privacy preserving","","2","","29","","15 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in practical application, we hope that the same activity of different people with various states and habits in different locations can be accurately recognized and produce the same reaction. Therefore, cross-domain sensing technology is pretty important. Some studies explore the location-independent and environment-independent methods, but few attempts consider the influence of the initial states of the users, such as standing and sitting, which actually have very different effects on the transmission of the wireless signal. This paper presents a human activity recognition method adapted to different initial states. Meanwhile, we solve the accompanying issue of the small sample size sensing, obviating the need for the cumbersome wok resulting from the massive data collection. We take advantage of the idea of metric learning and few-shot learning to realize cross-domain sensing with very few samples.

Our experiments conducted in a realistic environment reveal that energy efficiency cannot be improved or even deteriorates without a carefully designed offloading strategy. In this paper, we propose a selective traffic offloading scheme implemented as a smartphone middleware in a software-defined fashion, which consists of a packet classifier and a traffic scheduler. Using a light-weight machine learning approach exploiting unique smartphone context information, the packet classifier identifies packets generated on the fly as offloadable or not with substantially improved efficiency and feasibility on resource limited smartphones compared to traditional approaches.

In this paper, we study unsupervised learning techniques that efficiently do this without human intervention. As users simply move around an area of interest with mobile devices, the proposed method autonomously learns the characteristics of the surrounding environments and changes the ranging strategy accordingly. To this end, we use either model-based or neural network (NN)-based ranging modules for estimating the distance from neighboring anchor nodes, calculate the position of the devices using trilateration techniques, and define cost functions that indirectly evaluate the accuracy of the ranging module based on the trilateration results. Moreover, by assigning a unique trainable variable to each device, the proposed method is also able to compensate for different characteristics between devices without ground truth data. The performance of the proposed method is verified with a real-time location tracking application using received signal strength (RSS) measurements from conventional Wi-Fi access points (APs) or round trip time (RTT) measurements from APs that support the fine timing measurement (FTM) protocol. In cases where a model-based ranging module is used, the proposed method closely achieves the benchmark performance, which perfectly optimizes all the trainable variables on the test data. If NNs are adopted in the ranging module, the proposed method even outperforms the benchmark and achieves an average positioning accuracy of up to 2.397 m using RSS measurements, and up to 1.547 m using RTT measurements under the 40 MHz bandwidth configuration.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941657","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839041","Fine timing measurement (FTM);neural network;positioning;trilateration;unsupervised learning","Distance measurement;Protocols;Wireless fidelity;Standards;Unsupervised learning;Performance evaluation;Position measurement","Android (operating system);learning (artificial intelligence);mobile radio;neural nets;radiowave propagation;RSSI;telecommunication computing;unsupervised learning;wireless LAN","android APP implementation;wireless propagation channels;range-based positioning techniques;human intervention;mobile devices;surrounding environments;neural network-based ranging modules;trilateration techniques;unique trainable variable;signal strength measurements;fine timing measurement protocol;bandwidth configuration;round trip time measurements;received signal strength measurements;Wi-Fi access points;real-time location tracking;neighboring anchor nodes;positioning accuracy;distance estimation;indoor channels;unsupervised learning;frequency 40.0 MHz","","11","","59","CCBY","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, reconstructing an image of unknown objects based on the measurements of sparse signals is an ill-posed problem. To tackle these problems, we first present a linear model using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. We define the sparse beamforming problem as an ℓ<sub>0</sub>-norm optimization problem, then use the iterative reweighted ℓ<sub>1</sub> heuristic algorithm to obtain an optimal solution as a multipath. Finally, the multipath fading is removed by using Machine Learning. More specifically, we use Support Vector Regression (SVR) to identify a clear image of the unknown object.

It is also major to use a relevant input data that manages the complex radio propagation mediums. In indoor environments, a solution builds on fingerprinting approach based on the channel state information (CSI) between the target device and a single anchor gateway.

In this study, we use a neural network (NN) to learn the unique measurement patterns observed at different indoor environments and produce enhanced ranging outputs using raw measurements. Moreover, the NN is trained based on an unsupervised learning framework, using the naturally accumulated sensor data acquired from users accessing location services. Therefore, the effort involved in collecting training data is significantly minimized. The experimental results verified that the collection of unlabeled data for a short duration is sufficient to learn the pattern in raw measurements and produce improved ranging results. The proposed method reduced the ranging errors in raw distance measurements and well-calibrated ranging scenarios requiring the advance collection of ground truth data by 47-50% and 17-29%, respectively. Consequently, positioning error reduced by 17-30% in comparison with that of the well-calibrated ranging results.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3151018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9712371","Indoor positioning;round-trip time (RTT);fine timing measurement (FTM);neural network;inertial sensors","Distance measurement;Protocols;Wireless fidelity;Mobile handsets;Standards;Timing;Position measurement","","","","","","","IEEE","14 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

ITS networks are comprised of the Internet-connected vehicles (mobile nodes), roadside units (RSU), cellular base stations and conventional core network routers to create a complete data transmission platform that provides real-time traffic information and enable prediction of future traffic conditions. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of the underlying ITS networks raise new challenges in intrusion prevention of mobile network nodes and detection of security attacks due to such highly vulnerable mobile nodes. In this paper, we consider a new type of security attack referred to as crossfire attack, which involves a large number of compromised nodes that generate low-intensity traffic in a temporally coordinated fashion such that target links or hosts (victims) are disconnected from the rest of the network. Detection of such attacks is challenging since the attacking traffic flows are indistinguishable from the legitimate flows. With the support of software-defined networking that enables dynamic network monitoring and traffic characteristic extraction, we develop a machine learning model that can learn the temporal correlation among traffic flows traversing in the ITS network, thus differentiating legitimate flows from coordinated attacking flows. We use different deep learning algorithms to train the model and study the performance using Mininet-WiFi emulation platform.

The concept of no-interaction school attendance system can help us not only to evade the waste of valuable class time via attendance automation, but also prevent the spread of contagious diseases. This paper proposes a no-interaction school attendance scheme that utilizes machine learning concepts over Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values on the Wi-Fi 2.4GHZ frequency band. It frames the problem of attendance recording as binary classification problem where a student is present if he/she is adjacent to his peers that belong to the same class room and absent otherwise. A set of novel feature vectors was computed by considering the sequences of RSSI values as time series input to binary classifiers to predict a student’s location in a classroom.

In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of different fingerprint matching algorithms for Wi-Fi RSSI signal based localization systems. In the analysis, we used nearest neighbour (NN), k-nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN), weighted k -nearest neighbour (wkNN) and Bayesian fingerprint matching algorithms for user position estimation. The performance of these fingerprint matching algorithms is discussed in terms of average localization error and probability distribution of localization error. The experiment results show that the wkNN fingerprint matching algorithm gives high position accuracy as compared to other fingerprint matching algorithms.

Furthermore, we evaluate the transferability of the knowledge modeled by ensemble learners. When trained in a particular frequency or channel, such models are used to classify data captured over another different frequency.

Since LTE uses a TDMA/OFDMA scheduled approach, coexisting WiFi networks may face starvation if the channel is fully occupied by LTE-U transmissions. In this paper we derive a novel proportional fair allocation scheme that ensures fair coexistence between LTE-U and WiFi. Importantly, we find that the proportional fair allocation is qualitatively different from previously considered WiFi-only settings and that since the resulting allocation requires only quite limited knowledge of network parameters it is potentially easy to implement in practice, without the need for message-passing between heterogeneous networks.","2164-7038","978-1-4673-6305-1","10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247522","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7247522","LTE Unlicensed;LTE-U;LAA-LTE;WiFi;coexistence;proportional fairness","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Resource management;Throughput;Base stations;Optimization;Artificial neural networks;Conferences","frequency division multiple access;Long Term Evolution;message passing;OFDM modulation;time division multiple access;wireless LAN","proportional fair allocation scheme;unlicensed bands;LTE networks;TDMA-OFDMA scheduled approach;WiFi networks;message-passing;heterogeneous networks","","102","2","22","","14 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we present a novel twofactor authentication system called Wi-Access that requires no additional effort from the user beyond typing her credentials. The first factor is established by the knowledge of the password. Wi-Access uses the unique perturbations in the ambient WiFi signals caused by the hand and finger motions of the user during password entry as a way to confirm inherence (i.e., something that the user is) as the second factor for authentication. We show that the way in which Alice moves her hands and fingers while typing her password is uniquely manifested in the Channel State Information (CSI) of ubiquitous WiFi signals. We also show that if Bob types Alice's password, then the corresponding CSI signals are significantly distinct to Alice. Wi-Access uses Principle Component Analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the CSI data. A variance-based thresholding algorithm is used to extract the CSI signals that precisely correspond to the typing action. A one-class classifier based on an autoencoder that uses specific thresholds tailored to each user's training data is used to make the authentication decision. We implement Wi-Access using offthe-shelf 802.11n devices and evaluate its performance with 10 subjects. Our tests reveal that Wi-Access can on average achieve 92% authentication accuracy with 8% false positives.

Many recent studies explore this rich source of data to produce quite accurate results in device-free localization, human-body pose recognition, and device-free person identification under the umbrella of WiFi Sensing. Most works thus far rely on the use of the Intel 5300 Network Interface Card (NIC), a device requiring connection to a host computer to function. Because of this requirement, the weight and form factor of CSI recording capable devices (receiver or RX) has limited the abilities of researchers to explore certain aspects of WiFi sensing such as active repositioning and mobility of RX devices. To address this, in this paper, we use the ESP32 microcontroller to develop a simple and lightweight solution for CSI collection leveraging recent additions to the Espressif IoT Development Framework which allows user developed programs to access CSI directly. The system can work standalone or attached to a smartphone for advanced online computations. Thus, it can be easily deployed, repositioned, and carried on mobile objects, which can then help improve the performance of sensing tasks. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system through several deep-learning based human activity recognition experiments and show that the repositioning and mobility of RX devices can provide increases in accuracy upwards of 29.4% and 28.2%, respectively, compared to the commonly considered static RX scenario. Finally, we produce an easy to use open source codebase for researchers to immediately begin exploring the new possibilities (e.g., massive deployment) available by the usage of the proposed system.","","978-1-7281-7374-0","10.1109/WoWMoM49955.2020.00056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9217780","","Tools;Wireless fidelity;Sensors;Receivers;Portable computers;Hardware;OFDM","Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);microcontrollers;mobile computing;mobile radio;network interfaces;neural nets;OFDM modulation;signal detection;wireless LAN","active repositioning;channel state information;radio subcarrier frequencies;device-free localization;device-free person identification;ESP32 microcontroller;Espressif IoT development framework;standalone IoT based WiFi sensing;lightweight IoT based WiFi sensing;orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing;OFDM;human-body pose recognition;Intel 5300 network interface card;NIC;CSI collection;user developed programs;deep-learning based human activity recognition","","8","","36","","9 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In most attack scenarios, the adversary takes the local or remote control of the mobile device, by leveraging a vulnerability of the system, hence sending back the collected information to some remote web service. In this paper, we consider a different adversary, who does not interact actively with the mobile device, but he is able to eavesdrop the network traffic of the device from the network side (e.g., controlling a Wi-Fi access point). The fact that the network traffic is often encrypted makes the attack even more challenging.

Hardware and a software design are done to obtain an accurate and a real time output. In this paper, a prototype of the system is developed with the use of four sensors, (temperature, gas, pH and moisture), Arduino microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module to get the information about the presence of pesticides. The maximum level of pesticides that is accepted legally to be consumed by animals and humans is given by MRL. If a fruit is detected to belong in a range above or below the MRL then it is said to contain pesticides. Through IoT, the pesticide content and the values obtained from each sensors are stored in the Cloud server MATLAB ThikSpeak. Coming to the software design, CNN and SVM algorithms are chosen and the image of the fruit is diagnosed by them. Two algorithms are mainly used to compare the accuracy produced by both and to select the most accurate between the two. Deep Learning process is performed on the image of the fruit and the disease affected in the fruit is identified and later stored in the Cloud server. The information about the disease in fruits and the pesticide value in fruits, the harmful effect caused by it, are sent to the cloud, which is then processed and sent to the application present in the consumer's smart phone which is developed in HTML5, thereby a real time regular monitoring is possible.","","978-1-7281-5461-9","10.1109/ICOSEC49089.2020.9215373","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9215373","Pesticides;Fruits;Deep Learning;IoT;CNN","Machine learning;Diseases;Classification algorithms;Temperature sensors;Cloud computing;Support vector machines","agrochemicals;cloud computing;computerised monitoring;convolutional neural nets;gas sensors;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);microcontrollers;plant diseases;smart phones;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;temperature sensors;wireless LAN","fruit disease;harmful pesticides;software design;pesticide content;pesticide value;pesticide amount prediction;disease recognition;real time output;temperature sensor;gas sensor;pH sensor;moisture sensor;Arduino microcontroller;Wi-Fi module;cloud server Matlab ThikSpeak;CNN algorithm;SVM algorithm;consumer smart phone;HTML5;real time regular monitoring;IoT- deep learning","","2","","15","","7 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the diversity of interference sources, maintaining high level of network performance is becoming increasing difficult. Recently, deep learning based interference detection has been proposed as a potentially powerful way to identify sources of interference and to provide feedback on how to mitigate their effects. The performance of such approaches has been shown to be impressive in controlled evaluations. However, little information exists on how they generalize to the complexity of everyday environments. In this paper, we contribute by conducting a comprehensive performance evaluation of deep learning based interference detection. In our evaluation, we consider five orthogonal but complementary metrics: correctness, overfitting, robustness, efficiency, and interpretability. Our results show that, while deep learning indeed has excellent correctness (i.e., detection accuracy), it can be prone to noise in measurements (e.g., struggle when transmission power is dynamically adjusted) and suffers from poor interpretability. Deep learning is also highly sensitive to the quality and quantity of training data, with performance decreasing rapidly when the training and testing measurements come from environments with different characteristics. To compensate for weaknesses of deep learning, as our second contribution we propose a novel signal modeling approach for interference detection and compare it against deep learning. Our results demonstrate that, in terms of errors, there are some differences across the two approaches, with signal modeling being better at identifying technologies that rely on frequency hopping or that have dynamic spectrum signatures but suffering in other cases. Based on our results, we draw guidelines for improving interference detection performance.","2575-8411","978-1-7281-7002-2","10.1109/ICDCS47774.2020.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355762","interference detection;deep learning;cross technology interference;machine learning evaluation;benchmarks","Deep learning;Training;Training data;Interference;Robustness;Wireless fidelity;Testing","deep learning (artificial intelligence);interference suppression;wireless LAN","interference detection performance;WiFi cross-technology interference detection;WiFi networks;mobile communication solutions;ISM band;interference sources;network performance;deep learning based interference detection;comprehensive performance evaluation;detection accuracy;signal modeling approach;frequency 2.4 GHz","","","","34","","23 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing gesture recognition systems either require dedicated extra infrastructure or user's active cooperation. Although some WiFi-enabled gesture recognition systems have been proposed, they are vulnerable to environmental dynamics and rely on the tedious data re-labeling and expert knowledge each time being implemented in a new environment. In this paper, we propose a WiFi- enabled device-free adaptive gesture recognition scheme, WiADG, that is able to identify human gestures accurately and consistently under environmental dynamics via adversarial domain adaptation. Firstly, a novel OpenWrt-based IoT platform is developed, enabling the direct collection of Channel State Information (CSI) measurements from commercial IoT devices. After constructing an accurate source classifier with labeled source CSI data via the proposed convolutional neural network in the source domain (original environment), we design an unsupervised domain adaptation scheme to reduce the domain discrepancy between the source and the target domain (new environment) and thus improve the generalization performance of the source classifier. The domain- adversarial objective is to train a generator (target encoder) to map the unlabeled target data to a domain invariant latent feature space so that a domain discriminator cannot distinguish the domain labels of the data. In the phase of implementation, we utilize the trained target encoder to map the target CSI frame to the latent feature space and use the source classifier to identify various gestures performed by the user. We implement WiADG on commercial WiFi routers and conduct experiments in multiple indoor environments. The results validate that WiADG achieves 98% gesture recognition accuracy in the original environment. Furthermore, the proposed unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation is able to enhance the recognition accuracy of WiADG by 25% on average without the needs of labeled data collection and new classifier generation when implements it in new environments.","1095-2055","978-1-5386-5156-8","10.1109/ICCCN.2018.8487345","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8487345","","Gesture recognition;Wireless fidelity;Training;Generative adversarial networks;Feature extraction;Gallium nitride;Performance evaluation","gesture recognition;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;wireless LAN","multiple indoor environments;WiADG;unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation;labeled data collection;human-computer interaction;WiFi-enabled gesture recognition systems;device-free adaptive gesture recognition scheme;human gestures;commercial IoT devices;labeled source CSI data;source domain;unsupervised domain adaptation scheme;domain discrepancy;domain invariant latent feature space;domain discriminator;domain labels;trained target encoder;target CSI frame;WiFi routers;gesture recognition;human gesture recognition;expert knowledge;OpenWrt-based IoT platform","","14","","26","","11 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, training a high-performance ANN model requires a significant number of data, which are difficult to obtain in real environments. The main motivation for this work was to facilitate accurate prediction using small amount of measurement data. To this end, we propose a transfer learning-based prediction method with data augmentation. The proposed method pre-trains a prediction model using data generated from ray-tracing simulations, increases the number of data using simulation-assisted data augmentation, and then fine-tunes a model using the augmented data to fit the target environment.

However, most of the existing fusion methods exhibit two remarkable shortcomings: 1) they need to train and store offline weights by the supervised learning and 2) they directly fuse the so-called candidate location set (CLS), which is collected from the most likely location estimate of each classifier (location with the largest probability of being the true location predicted by the classifier), and thus do not fully leverage the knowledge of classifiers. In general, the fluctuation of RSS does not guarantee the location predicted by each classifier with the highest probability to be the true location, thus leading to severe performance degeneration of the existing fusion methods. To overcome the above shortcomings, we propose an accurate WiFi localization framework by unsupervised fusion of an extended CLS (ECLS). First, we train multiple classifiers by only using RSS fingerprints in the offline phase. In the online phase, instead of collecting the CLS from the trained classifiers, we construct an ECLS by augmenting CLS with other location estimates (locations with predication probability greater than a certain threshold) from each classifier. As compared with the CLS, ECLS provides a bigger fusion space that likely includes the true location of the user. Furthermore, an unsupervised fusion localization algorithm based on the ECLS is derived from the joint optimization of weights and the location of the user. Furthermore, a point of inflection searching algorithm is also proposed to intelligently construct the ECLS. Real experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is more robust to changing environments and model errors, and can significantly improve the localization accuracy without any fingerprint and hardware calibrations.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2870659","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371184,61671137,61771114,61771316); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:ZYGX2016J028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466583","Candidate location set (CLS);extended candidate location set (ECLS);indoor localization;received signal strength (RSS);unsupervised fusion;WiFi","Wireless fidelity;Indexes;Machine learning;IP networks;Testing;Frequency modulation;Support vector machines","optimisation;probability;search problems;signal classification;supervised learning;unsupervised learning;wireless LAN","extended candidate location set;ECLS;RSS fingerprints;predication probability;unsupervised fusion localization algorithm;WiFi localization framework;extended candidate location set fusion methods;multiple received signal strength based classifier predictions;supervised learning;optimization;inflection searching algorithm;calibrations","","25","","35","IEEE","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The first digital processing step at the receiver applied over the incoming discrete-time complex-baseband samples after analog-to-digital conversion is the packet detection step, i.e., the detection of the initial samples of each of the frames arriving within the incoming stream. Since the preambles usually contain repetitions of training symbols with good correlation properties, conventional digital receivers apply correlation-based methods for packet detection.

Due to the heterogeneity either in the IPS side (including radio map generation) and in the network infrastructure, we used an evaluation framework composed of 16 datasets.

The lumped matrix provides a simpler to understand description of the channel utilization behavior and naturally includes the persistence in one lumped state which resembles the characteristic behavior of naive predictors (where predicted state equals the current state). We demonstrate that treating the lumped states as classes allows good prediction models to be built using Logistic Regression and Neural Network models. Our results are based on IEEE 802.11 wireless utilization data collected as reported in the channel utilization (CU) field of the QBSS Load Element in Beacon frames.

The industrial robot with cellular network connection will be more flexible and intelligent than that without a network connection or with a conventional industrial communication network connection (e.g., fieldbus, real-time Ethernet, and WiFi). This is seen as the direction of development of the next generation of industrial robots. As a promising candidate for the next generation of cellular networks, fog radio access network (F-RAN) can provide artificial intelligence (AI) on the network edge, which is equipped with some computing and storage facilities, thus promoting the development of industrial robots in the future. In this article, we first propose a local-network cooperative control architecture for industrial robots in the F-RAN environment, which divides the robot controller into an onboard controller and a network controller, in order to decouple the basic control functions and application-dependent functions. The network controller is implemented on the fog access node (F-AP), and it possibly uses AI to bring advanced capabilities to the robot control. Then, based on the proposed architecture, a testbed for multiple automated guided vehicle (AGV) coordination in F-RAN has been designed and implemented, and a recurrent neural network (RNN)-empowered multi-AGV coordination policy is also developed. Finally, its performance is examined by several experiments. The results show that network intelligence deployed in F-RAN can improve the scheduling efficiency up to 35 percent, and the proposed control architecture can save huge backhaul traffic compared to the conventional cloud-based control architecture for industrial robots.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.001.1900346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9085264","","Robot kinematics;Service robots;Cloud computing;Computer architecture;Robot sensing systems;Artificial intelligence","artificial intelligence;automatic guided vehicles;automobile manufacture;cloud computing;control engineering computing;controllers;industrial robots;intelligent control;mobile robots;radio access networks;recurrent neural nets;scheduling;warehousing","network controller;recurrent neural network-empowered multiAGV coordination policy;F-RAN environment;cellular network connection;cellular networks;fog radio access network;robot controller;industrial communication network connection;network intelligence empowered industrial robot control;automobile manufacturing;warehousing;artificial intelligence;local-network cooperative control architecture;onboard controller;fog access node;automated guided vehicle;AGV","","7","","12","","4 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

A highly precise citywide indoor positioning service is possible, if an accurate city radio map is available. However, tremendous time and effort are required to construct a city radio map through manual calibration. This paper proposes a method for constructing a city radio map through the crowdsourcing of Wi-Fi fingerprints from numerous smartphones. The proposed method classifies the buildings in a city into three categories: buildings in residential areas, commercial areas, and public areas. Then, it develops location-labeling techniques appropriate for the collected fingerprints from buildings in each category.

Based on these observations, we propose a sign language recognition system called WiSign. Different from existing Wi-Fi signal-based human activity recognition systems, WiSign only requires a sparsely labeled training dataset. Two solutions based on transfer learning and semi-supervised learning are proposed to reduce the number of required labeled instances.

It is well known that indoor localization can obtain higher positioning accuracy than the single-fingerprint-based methods by fusing multiple information sources (fingerprints/fingerprint functions). However, the existing fusion methods cannot fully exploit the intrinsic complementarity among multiple information sources and thus show lower accuracy. In this paper, we propose an accurate WiFi localization approach by Fusing A Group Of fingerprinTs (WiFi-FAGOT) via a global fusion profile (GFP). WiFi-FAGOT first constructs a WiFi-based GrOup Of Fingerprints (GOOF) in the offline phase, which consists of RSS, signal strength difference, and hyperbolic location fingerprint. Then, instead of direct localization by using the WiFi-based GOOF, we design multiple classifiers by training each fingerprint in the WiFi-based GOOF, namely GOOF classifiers. To fully leverage the intrinsic complementarity among different kinds of fingerprints, we propose a GFP construction algorithm by minimizing the average positioning error over the space of all GOOF classifiers. Finally, in the online phase, we derive a grid-dependent matching algorithm, namely, optimal classifier selection, to intelligently choose a fusion profile in the GFP for more accurate localization.

In this study, we present a novel approach to infer user demographic information by exploiting the meta-data of Wi-Fi traffic. We develop an inference framework based on machine learning and evaluate its performance on a real-world dataset, which includes the Wi-Fi access of 28,158 users in five months.

Our analytical results show that, the overall accuracy of inferring gender and education level of users can be 82 and 78 percent, respectively.

In this paper, we compare the detection capability of Snort-Wireless and a Genetic Programming (GP) based intrusion detector, based on the ability to adapt to modified attacks, ability to adapt to similar unknown attacks and infrastructure independent detection. Our results show that the GP based detection system is much more robust against modified attacks compared to Snort-Wireless. Moreover, by focusing on the method(s) used in feature preprocessing for presentation to learning algorithms, GP based IDSs can achieve infrastructure independent detection and can adapt to similar unknown attacks too.

In the context of split computing, we propose two mechanisms that can reduce both computational and communicational overhead by finding a trade-off between them given as follows: (1) Dynamic Split Computation (DSC) mechanism: selects an optimal partition of DNN inference between IoT device and edge to reduce computation latency and computational resources. (2) Reliable Communication Network Switching (RCNS) mechanism: During poor network conditions, this mechanism provides suitable network selection to decide whether to choose Cellular (i.e., 4G/SG/6G), Wi-Fi or Bluetooth network, respectively based on the available bandwidth. To illustrate RCNS mechanism, we propose learning based reliable communication network switching (L-RCNS) and rule based reliable communication network switching (R-RCNS) models, respectively to provide reliable connectivity compared to Cellular/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth in poor network conditions. Based on the real data-set for Cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth collected by Samsung Galaxy S20 device and Raspberry Pi, we conduct extensive experiments to compare performance of the mechanisms with respect to the state of art.","","978-1-6654-2574-2","10.1109/FiCloud49777.2021.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9590311","Split Computing;Edge Computing;Internet of Things","6G mobile communication;Cloud computing;Bluetooth;Computational modeling;Switches;Reliability;Internet of Things","Bluetooth;cellular radio;cloud computing;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;neural nets;telecommunication network reliability;wireless LAN","split computing;Dynamic partitioning;6G vision;Deep Neural Networks;DNN models;IoT devices;computation capability;remotely deployed cloud;IoT platform;poor network conditions;DNN inference task;IoT-edge devices;computational overhead;communicational overhead;computational resources;suitable network selection;Bluetooth network;RCNS mechanism;based reliable communication network;reliable connectivity;Samsung Galaxy S20 device","","2","","23","","9 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is expected that current WLAN technologies will further evolve to obtain much higher performance, more energy efficiency and more robustness. However, the WLAN is still prone to a variety of attacks regardless of the existence of data protection and security association mechanisms. They include but not limited to dictionary attacks against the pre-shared secret key of Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)/WPA2, the key reinstallation attack (KRACK) against the handshake procedure of WPA2, etc. Although a brand new WPA3 has been recently standardized by Wi-Fi Alliance to address new security threats, it needs a long time to upgrade currently used access points. Hence, there is a significant gap between security and deployment cost. To fill this gap, we design and implement an intellignet WLAN Early warning Platform (iWEP) to provide an early warning service for clients. Specifically, iWEP adopts intelligence algorithms, e.g., machine learning, to provide the capability of defeating existing popular attacks, including Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) secret cracking, WPA/WPA2 dictionary attack, Denial-of-Service and KRACK, by handling behaviour features that are extracted from the compromising procedures in real experimental environments. Moreover, iWEP uses edge computing technology to make a good tradeoff between system performance and WLAN security. Finally, we implement a prototype system of iWEP, and the real results demonstrate its effectiveness.","","978-1-7281-5212-7","10.1109/MSN48538.2019.00079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9066146","Wireless local area network, early warning platform, edge computing, machine learning","Wireless LAN;Security;Feature extraction;Virtualization;Edge computing;Dictionaries;Machine learning","computer network security;cryptography;data privacy;distributed processing;telecommunication power management;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi Alliance;security threats;access points;deployment cost;intellignet WLAN Early warning Platform;iWEP;early warning service;KRACK;WLAN security;intelligent WLAN Early warning Platform;edge computing;Wireless Local Area Network;prevailing networking architectures;current WLAN technologies;energy efficiency;data protection;security association mechanisms;dictionary attacks;pre-shared secret key;key reinstallation attack;handshake procedure;WPA3","","","","14","","16 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study presents an approach to use WiFi Fingerprinting as a replacement for GPS information in order to allow seamlessly transition of localization architecture from outdoor to indoor environment. Often, movement speed of vehicle in indoor environment is low (10-12km/h) in comparison to outdoor scene but still surpasses human walking speed (3-5km/h, which is usually maximum movement speed for effective WiFi localization).

One major issue that hinders real-world deployment of these systems is position dependence, i.e., once the human target changes location and orientation, the sensing performance degrades significantly. Existing machine learning based methods aim to solve this problem by either generating high-dimensional features or transfer learning the environment knowledge. However, these methods require significant training effort and yet acquire limited improvement. In this paper, we start by understanding and analyzing the Doppler frequency shift in WiFi sensing. We then develop a WiFi frequency model to quantify the relationship between signal frequency and target position, motion direction and speed for human activities. Based on this theoretical model, we prove that the commonly-used movement speed and motion direction features are position dependent, and further identify movement fragments and relative motion direction changes as two position-independent features. Building upon the position-independent features, we design a suite of position-independent gestures and develop the gesture recognition system accordingly. Evaluation results show that under various conditions (i.e., different locations, orientations, environments, and persons), our system achieves more than 96% recognition accuracy without any training, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art machine learning based solutions.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2021.3063135","Project 2019BD005 supported by PKU-Baidu Fund(grant numbers:2019BD005); EU CHIST-ERA RadioSense Project; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2020109); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802373,A3 Project 62061146001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9366929","Time frequency feature;Position-independent;Gesture recognition;Contactless sensing;WiFi sensing","Sensors;Wireless fidelity;Training;Gesture recognition;Time-frequency analysis;Feature extraction;Mobile computing","","","","","","","IEEE","2 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Our proposed system is appropriate for indoor environments and utilizes a minimum description length principle (MDLP)-based radio map feedback (RMF) algorithm that simultaneously optimizes and updates the radio map. In the training phase, the proposed UDRM algorithm generates a radio map of the entire building based on the measured radio map of one reference floor. It does this by selectively applying a modified autoencoder and a generative adversarial network according to the spatial structures. Our proposed learning-based UDRM algorithm does not require labeled data, which is essential for supervised and semisupervised learning algorithms.

Our proposed RMF algorithm analyzes the distribution characteristics of the RSSIs for newly measured access points (APs) and feeds the analyzed results back to the radio map. The MDLP, which is applied to the proposed algorithm, improves the positioning performance and optimizes the size of the radio map by preventing the indefinite updating of the RSSI and by updating the newly added APs in the radio map.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2956986","National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education(grant numbers:2016R1D1A1B03934812); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8918264","Autoencoder;fingerprint;generative adversarial network (GAN);radio map;unsupervised learning","Fingerprint recognition;Sea measurements;Generators;Wireless fidelity;Generative adversarial networks;Unsupervised learning;Buildings","indoor radio;neural nets;optimisation;RSSI;unsupervised learning;wireless LAN","automatic Wi-Fi fingerprint system;unsupervised dual radio mapping algorithm;Wi-Fi signals;minimum description length principle-based radio map feedback algorithm;measured radio map;learning-based UDRM algorithm;supervised learning algorithms;semisupervised learning algorithms;RMF algorithm;Selective Unsupervised Learning-Based Wi-Fi Fingerprint System;GAN;time-cost reduction;MDLP-based RMF algorithm;modified autoencoder;generative adversarial network;spatial structures;received signal strength indicator data sets;RSSI data sets;RSSI distribution characteristic analysis;access points;positioning performance","","10","","33","IEEE","2 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While it has widely been deployed in WLANs, its potential is not fully exploited in real-world systems. This can be attributed to the large airtime overhead induced by channel acquisition in existing MU-MIMO protocols, which significantly compromises the throughput gain of MU-MIMO. In this paper, we present LB-SciFi, a learning-based channel feedback framework for MU-MIMO in WLANs. LB-SciFi takes advantage of recent advances in deep neural network autoencoder (DNN-AE) to compress channel state information (CSI) in 802.11 protocols, thereby conserving airtime and improving spectral efficiency. The key component of LB-SciFi is an online DNN-AE training scheme, which allows an AP to train DNN-AEs by leveraging the side information of existing 802.11 protocols. With this training scheme, DNN-AEs are capable of significantly lowering the airtime overhead for MU-MIMO while preserving its backward compatibility with incumbent Wi-Fi client devices. We have implemented LB-SciFi on a wireless testbed and evaluated its performance in indoor wireless environments. Experimental results show that LB-SciFi offers an average of 73% airtime overhead reduction and increases network throughput by 69% on average when compared to 802.11 feedback protocols.","2643-3303","978-1-7281-6992-7","10.1109/ICNP49622.2020.9259366","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9259366","MU-MIMO;Wi-Fi;beamforming;deep learning;explicit channel feedback","Wireless communication;Training;Protocols;Neural networks;Throughput;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Wireless fidelity","feedback;learning (artificial intelligence);MIMO communication;multi-access systems;neural nets;protocols;wireless channels;wireless LAN","LB-SciFi;DNN-AE;airtime overhead;802.11 feedback protocols;online learning-based channel feedback;multiuser MIMO;next-generation wireless local area networks;WLAN;MU-MIMO protocols;learning-based channel feedback framework","","1","","41","","20 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, in the offline phase, we cluster the offline fingerprints via Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to divide the localization area into several subareas. Then a random forest-based subarea classifier is trained by the offline data and corresponding subarea labels. In the online phase, the subarea of the query fingerprint is firstly predicted by the trained RF-based classifier. Finally, a fusion fingerprint-based adaptive KNN algorithm is utilized to estimate the location in the predicted subarea.

This approach depends upon fingerprinting effort. However, fingerprint data are susceptible to factors like time and device heterogeneity. Thus, identifying stable Access Points (APs) is important such that, the signal for those APs do not vary much even when training and test conditions change. Localization with stable APs not only provides sustainable localization accuracy but also saves location prediction time. Consequently, in this paper, we propose an algorithm for identifying stable APs in an real indoor environment of our university campus subject to time and device heterogeneity. Our proposed algorithm is found to select 20 stable APs irrespective of time and device variation out of all APs (46) which give an average error of 1.3 meter and 90.13% localization accuracy using KNN whereas, considering all APs KNN can achieve an accuracy of 84.20% with an average error of 2.10 meter.","","978-1-5386-3719-7","10.1109/EAIT.2018.8470401","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8470401","Indoor localization;InfoGain;RSSI;Wi-Fi;KNN;AP","Androids;Humanoid robots;Indoor environments;Training;Wireless fidelity;Data collection;Meters","indoor radio;nearest neighbour methods;notebook computers;wireless LAN","device heterogeneity;device variation;APs KNN;smart-handhelds;wireless Access Points;Wi-Fi-based indoor localization;indoor environment;fingerprinting effort;fingerprint data;stable Access Points;sustainable localization accuracy;location prediction time","","5","","7","","23 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing Wi-Fi fingerprint-based localization solutions are not sufficient for tracing moving target due to the unexpected noises of the Wi-Fi measurements. In view of this, this study is dedicated to implementing a robust indoor tracking system via the joint of Wi-Fi fingerprint and the PDR (pedestrian dead reckoning) techniques. Specifically, we first propose a two-steps joint localization approach, in which K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) is adopted to estimate the initial location based on Wi-Fi fingerprint, and then the PDR is adopted to refine the location based on the acceleration and the forwarding direction, which are detected by the embedded sensors in mobile devices. Specifically, the displacement is estimated via the direction, the stride length and the acceleration. Then, the Wi-Fi fingerprintbased estimated position and the PDR estimated position are fused based on Kalman filter. The main idea is to set the Wi-Fi fingerprint-based position as observation vectors, which are further used to update the PDR estimated positions. Finally, we conduct a series of experiments in a real-world environment, which demonstrate the effectiveness and the robustness of the developed indoor tracking system. In addition, our filed testing also demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve the indoor localization accuracy.","","978-1-5386-9380-3","10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560228","Indoor localization;Wi-Fi measurements;PDR;Kalman filter","","indoor navigation;Kalman filters;radionavigation","initial location;PDR estimated position;Kalman filter;Wi-Fi fingerprint-based position;developed indoor tracking system;indoor localization accuracy;indoor location-based services;Wi-Fi fingerprint-based localization solutions;Wi-Fi measurements;robust indoor tracking system;PDR techniques;two-steps joint localization approach;joint Wi-Fi-PDR localization","","3","","15","","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, PIN can be easily leaked to others, and biometrics usually require specialized devices. In this paper, we prototype our system, a new method for user authentication by leveraging commodity WiFi. The basic methodology is to explore the typing habit of users from Channel State Information (CSI). The design and implementation of our system face two challenges, i.e. extracting keystroke features from wireless channel data and authenticating the user via typing habit from the corresponding keystroke features. For the former, we capture signal fluctuations caused by the micro movements like typing and extract the keystroke features on channel response obtained from commodity WiFi devices. For the latter, we design a computational intelligence driven mechanism to authenticate users from the corresponding keystroke feature. We prototype our system on the low-cost off-the-shelf WiFi devices and evaluate its performance in real-world experiments. We have explored four classifiers including K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree for recognizing users.

Fingerprinting-based algorithms critically rely on a fingerprint database built from machine learning methods, and extreme machine learning (ELM) is preferred for its fast training speed. However, traditional WiFi based IPS usually requires a central server to collect and process data, which is tremendously vulnerable to server breakdown and communication link failure. To address this issue, we propose Consensus-based Parallel ELM (CPELM) to enhance the robustness by distributing the data on different computation nodes. Specifically, each node keeps updating the corresponding terms in the ELM regression equation as a weighted average of those from neighboring nodes based on the distributed consensus iterative scheme. Upon the agreement of the regression equation within the network, the output weight of ELM can be calculated on some nodes and propagated to other nodes. Extensive simulation with real data has demonstrated that CPELM is able to produce same level of localization accuracy as centralized ELM without incurring additional computational cost, and in the meanwhile provides more robustness to the entire IPS in case of server breakdown and link failures.","","978-1-5090-1328-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841684","","Servers;Training;IP networks;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Electric breakdown;Machine learning algorithms;Robustness","failure analysis;indoor navigation;Internet of Things;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);radionavigation;regression analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability;wireless LAN","consensus-based parallel extreme machine learning;indoor localization;Internet of Things;WiFi fingerprinting based indoor positioning system;IPS;fingerprint database;central server;data collection;data processing;communication link failure;server breakdown;CPELM;ELM regression equation;neighboring nodes;distributed consensus iterative scheme","","9","","14","","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Wi-Fi Positioning Algorithm based on the existing RF Fingerprint can obtain high positioning accuracy, but there is a big shortage of large deployment and maintenance cost. In order to reduce the cost of Wi-Fi fingerprints collection, this paper utilizes the RSS collected by the consumers using the mobile phone for electronic payment, constructs the low cost crowdsourcing Wi-Fi RF Fingerprint, and realizes the shop-level accurate positioning with CNN. Based on the feature of CNN extraction from local to global, this paper constructs a characteristic group which includes signal intensity, user transaction time and shop information. The statistics of each feature in the statistical interval are obtained by using the interval of 1 to 23 days before the current time.

However, there is a trade-off between acquiring channel quality information and improving protocol efficiency because channel estimation consumes time and frequency resource that ideally should be used for data transfer. In this paper, we present D-Fi (Diversity-aware Wi-Fi), a novel Wi-Fi PHY/MAC protocol, that capitalizes on frequency diversity gains while sustaining protocol efficiency. The D-Fi design allows to estimate channel quality while D-Fi is performing channel contention using an OFDM-based Bloom filter. To resolve the ambiguity caused by the Bloom filter, we adopt two methods: (i) An analysis-based multi channel backoff method enables to explore/exploit frequency diversity while reducing the occurrence of the ambiguity. (ii) Applying machine learning (ML) methods to the D-Fi PHY/MAC protocol corrects the ambiguity taken place already and makes our protocol reliable.

By clustering these RSS fingerprints into one region, the commonly utilized KNN algorithm in the past cannot achieve accurate positioning in the region. For this, we introduce a concept of the insensitive region of the RSS fingerprint and a new algorithm named DBSCAN-KRF. This algorithm can delete noise sample and detect insensitive region, then, different methods are selected to achieve indoor positioning by judging the region of the estimated fingerprint sample, the KNN algorithm is selected when the region is sensitive, and random forest algorithm is selected when the region is insensitive.

The system was specially designed to analyze unbalance, load, and rotor obstructions in a rotating machine. Two sensor nodes were installed on an apparatus: one in the shaft and the other on the support table. The acceleration signals were used to analyze the machine vibration in the frequency domain by its Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This spectrum was pre-analyzed on the sensor node, and the most significant features were sent to a cloud platform. These nodes were mounted to acquire vibration from an electric bicycle motor. Three situations were simulated: unbalance, using weights at the endings of rim spokes; mechanical load, using neodymium magnets, through the principle of eddy currents; and rotor obstruction, using an object made with a nylon cable. The solution presented was used to measure vibration and calculate its spectrum and send it to the cloud. The signals were analyzed using three strategies: an FFT amplitude level comparison, logistic regression, and neural network (NN). The analyses were carried out using the signals of each sensor independently and as a sensor network, this last showing better results.

With the resent boom of mobile devices (e.g., Tablet computers, smart phones, smart devices, and wearable computing), the number of network users is bound to increase exponentially. But, most of the communications protocols, that span over the 7 layers of the OSI model, were designed in the late 1980's or 90's. Although most of these protocols have had subsequent updates over time, most of these protocols still remain largely unsecure and open to attacks. Hence it is critically important to secure these protocols across the 7 layers of the OSI model. As a part of my PhD research, I am working on a cross layer anomaly behavior detection system for various protocols. This system will be comprised of intrusion detection systems (IDS) for each of the protocols that are present in each layer. The behavior analysis of each protocol will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase (training), the features that accurately characterize the normal operations of the protocol are identified using data mining and statistical techniques and then use them to build a runtime model of protocol normal operations. In addition, some known attacks against the studied protocol are also studied to develop a partial attack model for the protocol. The anomaly behavior analysis modules of each layer are then fused to generate a highly accurate detection system with low false alarms. In the second phase, the cross-layer anomaly based IDS is used to detect attacks against any communication protocols. We have already developed anomaly behavior modules for TCP, UDP, IP, DNS and Wi-Fi protocols. Our experimental results show that our approach can detect attacks accurately and with very low false alarms.","","978-1-4673-8439-1","10.1109/SASOW.2015.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7306574","Cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;machine learning;data mining;DNS;Wi-Fi","Protocols;Intrusion detection;Cross layer design;Conferences;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Databases;Open systems","data mining;protocols;security of data;statistical analysis","cross layer anomaly based intrusion detection system;computer networks;network capacity;mobile devices;tablet computers;smart phones;smart devices;wearable computing;communications protocols;OSI model;IDS;data mining;statistical techniques;partial attack model;anomaly behavior analysis modules;Wi-Fi protocols;DNS protocols;IP protocols;UDP protocols;TCP protocols;false alarms","","3","","7","","29 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wi-Fi signals can be affected by their reflection, refraction, and absorption by moving objects in their path. The channel state information (CSI), a signal property indicator, of the Wi-Fi signal can be analyzed for human activity recognition (HAR). Deep learning-based HAR models can enhance performance and accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency. However, to save computational power, an inception network, which uses a variety of techniques to boost speed and accuracy, can be adopted. In contrast, the concept of spatial attention can be applied to obtain refined features. In this paper, we propose a human–human interaction (HHI) classifier, CSI-IANet, which uses a modified inception CNN with a spatial-attention mechanism. The CSI-IANet consists of three steps: i) data processing, ii) feature extraction, and iii) recognition. The data processing layer first uses the second-order Butterworth low-pass filter to denoise the CSI signal and then segment it before feeding it to the model. The feature extraction layer uses a multilayer modified inception CNN with an attention mechanism that uses spatial attention in an intense structure to extract features from captured CSI signals. Finally, the refined features are exploited by the recognition section to determine HHIs correctly. To validate the performance of the proposed CSI-IANet, a publicly available HHIs CSI dataset with a total of 4800 trials of 12 interactions was used. The performance of the proposed model was compared to those of existing state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that CSI-IANet achieved an average accuracy of 91.30%, which is better than that of the existing best method by 5%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3134794","Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation(grant numbers:2021-0-00467); BK21 FOUR Program of the NRF; Ministry of Education(grant numbers:NRF5199991514504); Basic Science Research Programs under the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Science and ICT(grant numbers:2019R1C1C1006806,2021R1A4A1030775); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9646919","Channel state information (CSI);convolution neural network (CNN);deep learning;inception module;spatial attention","Wireless fidelity;Feature extraction;Sensors;Hidden Markov models;Wireless communication;Robot sensing systems;Wireless sensor networks","Butterworth filters;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);feature extraction;image filtering;image motion analysis;low-pass filters;wireless LAN","human-human interaction classifier;CSI-IANet;spatial-attention mechanism;CSI signal;feature extraction layer;multilayer modified inception CNN;inception attention network;human-human interaction recognition;Wi-Fi infrastructures;device-free passive-sensing features;Wi-Fi signal;signal property indicator;human activity recognition;deep learning-based HAR models;HHI CSI dataset;second-order Butterworth low-pass filter;HHI classifier;data processing","","","","52","CCBY","10 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But people do not pay enough attention to ensuring the security of these systems. As a result of the resulting security gaps, an attacker can launch an attack, not only shutting down the system, but also having some negative impact on the environment. The article examines denial of service attacks in ad-hoc networks, conducts experiments and considers the consequences of their successful execution. As a result of the research, it was determined that an attack can be detected by changes in transmitted traffic and processor load. The cyber-physical system operates on stable algorithms, and even if legal changes occur, they can be easily distinguished from those caused by the attack. The article shows that the use of statistical methods for analyzing traffic and other parameters can be justified for detecting an attack. This study shows that each attack affects traffic in its own way and creates unique patterns of behavior change.

Those behaviors can be sensed according to their influence on the signals of neighboring WiFi devices (we call these devices Check Points). A machine learning method is used to train a classifier to identify the above behaviors.

However, the data-hungry and location-specific training process hinders its scalable deployment at large sizes. In this work, we propose WiFederated, a federated learning (FL) approach to train machine learning models for WiFi sensing tasks. Using WiFederated, client devices can not only perform training in parallel at the edge instead of sequentially at a central server but can also collaboratively learn and share generalizable location-independent traits about physical actions being monitored. We demonstrate that an FL model trained on as few as 2-3 locations can provide high prediction accuracy in new locations even without any data available from them. We also demonstrate how new locations can achieve higher prediction accuracy even with a small number of available samples when using the pretrained FL model rather than training from scratch. The results show that the FL model can save local training epochs and reduce the need for large data collection at each new location. Thus, the proposed WiFederated system scales as more locations are added. We show that WiFederated provides a more accurate and time efficient solution compared to existing transfer learning and adversarial learning solutions thanks to the parallel training ability at multiple clients. By introducing new client selection methods during the FL process, we also show that accuracy can further increase. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of training models at the edge and introduce continuous annotation to allow for continuous learning over time.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3137793","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1744624); Commonwealth Cyber Initiative CCI; Virginia Commonwealth University(grant numbers:Presidential Research Quest Fund (PeRQ)); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9659826","WiFi sensing;federated learning;channel state information (CSI);device-free sensing.","Wireless fidelity;Sensors;Training;Predictive models;Collaborative work;Task analysis;Data models","","","","","","","IEEE","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For capturing more human walking dynamics, two receivers together with one transmitter are deployed in different spatial layouts. The Channel State Information (CSI) from different receivers are first assembled and refined to form an integrated walking profile. Then, the RNN encoder reads and encodes the walking profile into primary feature vectors. Given a specific gait or direction sensing task, a corresponding and particular attention vector is computed by the decoder and is finally used to predict the target. The attention scheme motivates AGait to learn to adaptively align with different critical clips of CSI data for different tasks.

Conventional pedestrian O-D estimation methods, such as surveys, smart card, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or CCTV cameras, require active user involvement or favorable lighting conditions. Motivated by the wide applications of RGB-D cameras that can provide an ambient illumination-independent channel, in this paper, we propose an RGB-D based pedestrian O-D estimation framework, which can work properly in fires, or low lighting conditions. Firstly, we train a joint convolutional neural network (CNN) on three modalities, including RGB, depth and infrared images. Subsequently, for evaluating person re-identification algorithm and O-D estimation framework, we collect and annotate a new top view RGB-D dataset considering different levels of service and lighting conditions, which we will make publicly available. Our experiment results demonstrate that the fusion of multiple modalities improves the pedestrian detection and reidentification accuracy by 13.4% compared with using single RGB modality. Especially in low lighting conditions where RGB cameras perform poorly, we can still achieve an accuracy of 72.8% using depth cameras.","","978-1-7281-5322-3","10.1109/ICFSFPE48751.2019.9055868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9055868","Origin-destination estimation;convolutional neural network;RGB-D camera","","cameras;convolutional neural nets;emergency management;image colour analysis;infrared imaging;learning (artificial intelligence);lighting;object detection;pedestrians","low lighting conditions;joint convolutional neural network;infrared images;pedestrian detection;reidentification accuracy;depth cameras;pedestrian origin-destination estimation;emergency scenarios;efficient emergency management;pedestrian route choices;origin zones;destination zones;active user involvement;RGB-D cameras;ambient illumination-independent channel;pedestrian O-D estimation methods;person reidentification algorithm;origin-destination matrix;CNN training","","","","24","","6 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unsupervised anomaly detection methods, which are based on machine learning for fault detection in the ICT systems, use various kinds of data such as traffic data, memory usage data, CPU usage data, and text log data. The problem of deploying unsupervised anomaly detection methods in real ICT systems is that these data may have missing values. When a record has missing values, existing unsupervised anomaly detection ignores the records or imputes missing values with specific values. However, both operations lead to decreased performance of the anomaly detection methods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method that can handle records with missing values without imputation by using a neural network that can process variable length inputs. We experimented with 22 benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed method for various kinds of data. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method performs better than existing methods in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) on average for two cases in which 1) neither training nor test data include incomplete data, and 2) both training and test data include incomplete data. Moreover, we experimented with data from a Wi-Fi service that have missing values.

Using the situated shop location of users, the accuracy of the message and advertisement delivery can be effectively promoted. Though the Wi-Fi based positioning has become the mainstream of indoor positioning technology, the large deployment and maintenance cost limits its widespread use. In this paper, we proposed a novel zero-cost and map-free shop-level localization algorithm. The algorithm collected Wi-Fi fingerprinting data and opportunistic GPS data when customers paid the bill through mobile payment app. This algorithm takes each shop identification as a location index and localizes user without the need of the map. The Wi-Fi fingerprints and GPS data are collected in the background when crowdsourcing users employ the mobile payment APP, so our proposed localization algorithm can work without any site survey. To improve the positioning accuracy and speed up localization calculation, we introduce a hierarchical classification method based on ensemble learning model. The upper classifier dynamically selects several local candidate shops with an online Wi-Fi fingerprinting, with the virtue of reducing the computational complexity. After completing the upper classification, we further perform a confidence-weighted ensemble classification combing using GBDT, random forest and KNN to estimate the user location. By aggregating the location estimations of individual classifiers with their corresponding positioning accuracy, the confidence-weighted ensemble classification model can obtain more accurate location estimation. The paper also introduces some features, i.e., historical shop scanning Wi-Fi ratio, Wi-Fi signal statistics, store type and transaction time distribution, to improve the accuracy of the bottom shop classifier.

Due to the complexity of large-scale network topology and dynamic of mobile nodes, vehicular communication is difficult to be established in an ultra-reliable and low-latency way. Existing efforts of vehicular communications mainly focused on historical trajectories and perform experiments on simulated road networks with free moving vehicles, or just analyze a limited scope of traffic pattern over public vehicles. However, previous studies ignored the traffic pattern of urban private vehicles, leading to a narrow perception for data transmission. To make up for this blind spot, we propose a data-driven method for vehicular communications by analyzing the traffic pattern of urban vehicles. We model the urban vehicles traffic pattern by deep neural networks and clustering technique is applied to enhance the ability of collecting data for vehicles. Additionally, to deal with the unbalanced traffic load in road networks, we devise a novel method to detect the appropriate location for deploying auxiliary WiFi-spots to help data transmission in low traffic load area. Therefore, our solution enables the data packets to be transmitted in an optimal way thus comprehensive and valuable information is collected for guiding the transmission. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art vehicular communication methods in terms of diffusion speed and range in urban vehicular networks.","2472-8489","978-1-7281-2184-0","10.1109/ICCSN.2019.8905402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8905402","data-driven;urban vehicles;vehicular communication;urban vehicular networks","Roads;Trajectory;Traffic control;Telecommunication traffic;Wireless fidelity;Surveillance;Data communication","intelligent transportation systems;mobile radio;neural nets;road traffic;road vehicles;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication network topology;telecommunication traffic;traffic engineering computing;wireless LAN","vehicular communication methods;simulated road networks;large-scale network topology;data packets exchange;data-driven vehicular communications;urban vehicular network;low traffic load;clustering technique;deep neural networks;urban vehicles traffic pattern;data-driven method;data transmission;urban private vehicles","","","","19","","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A first issue related to this paradigm is the need for a coordinator, called controller, able to decide when activating a D2D connection is appropriate and to manage such connection. In this view, the paradigm of Software Defined Networking (SDN) can be exploited both to handle the data flows among the devices and to interact directly with every device. This work is focused on a scenario where a device is selected by the SDN controller, in order to become the master node of a WiFi-Direct network. The remaining nodes, called clients, can exchange data with other nodes through the master. The objective is to infer, through different Machine Learning approaches, the number of nodes actively involved in receiving data, exploiting only the information available at the client side and without modifying any standard communication protocol. The information about the number of client nodes is crucial when, e.g., a user desires a precise prediction of the transmission estimated time of arrival (ETA) while downloading a file.","","978-1-5090-1328-9","10.1109/GLOCOM.2016.7841821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7841821","","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Device-to-device communication;Protocols;Wireless communication;Software;Smart phones;Batteries","learning (artificial intelligence);software defined networking;wireless LAN","receiving node number estimation;IEEE 802.11 network;machine learning technique;multiple wireless interface;device to device communication;D2D paradigm;software defined networking;SDN controller;W-Fi-direct network","","6","","24","","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Network traffic classification represents an essential task in the whole chain of network security. Some of the most important and widely spread applications of traffic classification are the ability to classify encrypted traffic, the identification of malicious traffic flows, and the enforcement of security policies on the use of different applications. Passively monitoring a network utilizing low-cost and low-complexity wireless local area network (WLAN) devices is desirable. Mobile devices can be used or existing office desktops can be temporarily utilized when their computational load is low. This reduces the burden on existing network hardware. The aim of this paper is to investigate traffic classification techniques for wireless communications. To aid with intrusion detection, the key goal is to passively monitor and classify different traffic types over WLAN to ensure that network security policies are adhered to. The classification of encrypted WLAN data poses some unique challenges not normally encountered in wired traffic. WLAN traffic is analyzed for features that are then used as an input to six different machine learning (ML) algorithms for traffic classification. One of these algorithms (a Gaussian mixture model incorporating a universal background model) has not been applied to wired or wireless network classification before. The authors also propose a ML algorithm that makes use of the well-known vector quantization algorithm in conjunction with a decision tree-referred to as a TRee Adaptive Parallel Vector Quantiser. This algorithm has a number of advantages over the other ML algorithms tested and is suited to wireless traffic classification. An average F-score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) > 0.84 was achieved when training and testing on the same day across six distinct traffic types.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2016.2562259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7475937","Traffic classification;machine learning;WLAN;WI-Fi","Wireless LAN;Monitoring;Cryptography;Feature extraction;Ports (Computers);Algorithm design and analysis","decision trees;Gaussian processes;learning (artificial intelligence);security of data;wireless LAN","radio frequency traffic classification;wireless local area network;intrusion detection;network security policies;WLAN traffic;machine learning algorithms;Gaussian mixture model;ML algorithm;tree adaptive parallel vector quantiser;decision tree","","21","","45","IEEE","20 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, studies on establishing fingerprint databases are relatively rare under the condition of sparse reference points. In this paper, we propose a novel data augmenter based on the adversarial networks to build fingerprint databases with sparse reference points. Additionally, two conditions of these networks are designed to generate data effectively and stably, which are 0-1 sketch and Gaussian sketch. Based on the networks, we design two augmenters with different cyclic training strategies to evaluate the augmenting effects comparatively. Meanwhile, five quantitative evaluation metrics of the augmenters are proposed from two perspectives of the artificial experiences and the data features, and some of them are also used as the gradient penalties for generators. Finally, experiments corresponding to these metrics and localization accuracies demonstrate that the data augmenter with the 0-1 sketch adversarial network is more efficient, effective and stable totally.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971269","Project Intelligence Service Platform for Medium, Small and Micro-Enterprises Based on Big Data; Anhui Major Science and Technology Projects(grant numbers:711245801052); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8979339","CGAN;sketch;quantitative evaluation metrics;RSS","Databases;Training;Generators;Measurement;Neural networks;Generative adversarial networks;Gallium nitride","Gaussian processes;indoor navigation;indoor radio;neural nets;radionavigation;RSSI;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","sparse reference points;augmenting effects;data features;WiFi-based indoor localization applications;localization accuracy reliance;fingerprint databases;RSS data augmenter;0-1 sketch adversarial network;gradient penalties;Gaussian sketch","","3","","66","CCBY","3 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Federated learning thus addresses the privacy issues of traditional machine learning. However, federated learning faces the energy constraints of the workers and the high network resource cost due to the fact that a number of global model transmissions may be required to achieve the target accuracy. To address the energy constraint, a power beacon can be used that recharges energy to the workers. However, the model owner may need to pay an energy cost to the power beacon for the energy recharge. To address the high network resource cost, the model owner can use a WiFi channel, called default channel, for the global model transmissions. However, communication interruptions may occur due to the instability of the default channel quality. For this, special channels such as LTE channels can be used, but this incurs channel cost. As such, the problem of the model owner is to decide amounts of energy recharged to the workers and to choose channels used to transmit its global model to the workers to maximize the number of global model transmissions while minimizing the energy and channel costs. This is challenging for the model owner under the uncertainty of the channel, energy and mobility states of the workers. In this paper, we thus propose to employ the Deep Q-Network (DQN) that enables the model owner to find the optimal decisions on the energy and the channels without any a priori network knowledge. Simulation results show that the proposed DQN always achieves better performance compared to the conventional algorithms.","","978-1-7281-5503-6","10.1109/WF-IoT48130.2020.9221089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9221089","Federated learning;deep reinforcement learning;channel selection;energy allocation;mobility","Costs;Uncertainty;Simulation;Stochastic processes;Reinforcement learning;Collaborative work;Data models","data privacy;groupware;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;neural nets;power aware computing;resource allocation","WiFi channel;data privacy;machine learning;DQN;deep Q-network;deep reinforcement learning;default channel;resource allocation;energy recharge;power beacon;energy constraint;mobility-aware federated learning networks;default channel quality;global model transmissions","","8","","14","","13 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Building structure information is necessary for the realization of indoor location information services (indoor LBSs). In indoor pedestrian networks and building structure information, since the shortest route calculation can be directly applied, the route from an arbitrary position to a destination can be obtained by a computer. Therefore, navigation and recommending a healthier route is possible by route recommendation. However, the generation of the indoor pedestrian network is costly, so it does not necessarily exist. Therefore, as a low-cost generation method, our final goal is to automatically generate an indoor pedestrian network structure by collecting the walking sensing data from many users and integrating the estimated 3-D walking trajectories. In the integration of such trajectories, such partial matching places as walking in the same passage are used as clues. To estimate a partially matched place, we use a stable zone (a stable walking zone) and linear walking. Since the stable walking zone detects the continuation of the state with only a slight change, the estimation accuracy becomes higher than the right and left turns. We estimate the correspondence among stable walking zones by machine learning using the walking time, the walking distance, the height, and Wi-Fi information. For machine learning, we use a support vector machine (SVM). From the results of an evaluation experiment with HASC-IPSC, an indoor walking sensing corpus, we obtained a result where the F value was 0.81.","","978-4-907626-34-1","10.23919/ICMU.2018.8653585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653585","","Legged locomotion;Buildings;Trajectory;Estimation;Sensors;Machine learning;Wireless fidelity","indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);location based services;pedestrians;support vector machines;wireless LAN","shortest route calculation;low-cost generation method;indoor pedestrian network structure;walking sensing data;3-D walking trajectories;partially matched place;walking time;walking distance;indoor walking sensing corpus;partial matching estimation method;building structure information;indoor location information services;indoor LBSs;indoor walking trajectories;machine learning;stable walking zone;support vector machine","","1","","15","","28 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, WiFi signals have been used in a large number of proposals to achieve indoor positioning, many of which use kNN to do so. It is nearly standard to consider the error of indoor positioning as the third quartile of the error thanks, among other reasons, to the IPIN competitions. However, this calculation obtains the global error of a system, but not the accuracy of a single measure if the true position is unknown: what is the accuracy of a single point? This work answers to this question by applying error calculation theory to the kNN algorithm of positioning using a fingerprinting method. The paper shows that an error analysis can help not only to know the accuracy of a position, but also: to understand the advantages of one distance calculation or another, in particular, Euclidean versus Manhattan; to know which elements have the main contribution to the error of position and, therefore, use this argument when deciding how to make the calculation; and also to know the quality of a single map of fingerprints as a tool to know the position.

Fingerprinting techniques can provide a low-cost and high-accuracy localization solution by utilizing in-building communication infrastructures. However, existing fingerprinting localization algorithms are not resistant to outliers, for example, the accidental environment changes, access point (AP) attacks. Another drawback is that traditional K nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm in the literature may not select the candidate reference points (RPs) correctly. In this paper, we propose a novel environmentally robust and attack resistant probabilistic fingerprinting localization method. In the offline phase, the distribution estimation of the signal strength is performed using probabilistic histogram method. Then in the online phase, a three-step location sensing method is proposed. In the first step, a simple and efficient outlier detection method named non-iterative “RANdom SAmple Consensus” (RANSAC) is run to detect and eliminate part of APs from which the signals measured are severely distorted by unexpected environment effects. In the second step, a novel region-based RP selection method which works like a “family of probability” is proposed to improve the possibility of the correctness of selection of the nearest RPs. In the final step, the location is obtained using a weighted-mean method. In the experiment section, we demonstrate the proposed method in our lab and find that the proposed strategies are resistant to outliers and can improve the localization accuracy effectively compared with existing methods.","","978-1-4577-1804-5","10.1109/IPIN.2011.6071908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6071908","fingerprinting;indoor localization;Wi-Fi;signal strength;sensor network;wireless network;RANSAC","Probabilistic logic;Histograms;Accuracy;Robustness;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Distortion measurement;Sensors","fingerprint identification;indoor radio;radio networks;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","robust Wi-Fi fingerprinting indoor localization;secure Wi-Fi fingerprinting indoor localization;indoor positioning;Wi-Fi wireless networks;in-building communication infrastructures;access point attacks;K nearest neighbor algorithm;KNN;reference points;probabilistic fingerprinting localization method;distribution estimation;random sample consensus;weighted-mean method","","40","4","10","","10 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the previous behavioral authentication research relied on historical behavioral patterns or trained classification models, thus requiring a large amount of preliminary data. In addition, while many studies utilized multiple authentication factors, authentication scores of each element were calculated independently without using correlations between them. This paper proposes a new authentication approach that uses behavioral correlations between each factor. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal, we constructed a correlation-based authentication method using the data collected from smartphones and wearable activity trackers, including GPS locations, Wi-Fi access points, and activity types inferred from the metabolic equivalent of task (MET). Since the proposed method matches the data from multiple sensors to verify the request rather than utilizing the pattern extracted from the historical data, it does not require a large amount of preliminary data. We also employed a neural network-based score fusion method that aggregates the three authentication scores to improve the final authentication accuracy. The experimental result showed that the proposed method could achieve a half total error rate (HTER, an arithmetic average of a false rejection rate and false acceptance rate) of merely 8.0% that is much lower than other classification methods using the same dataset.","2331-9860","978-1-6654-3161-3","10.1109/CCNC49033.2022.9700626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9700626","behavioral authentication;multi-factor authentication;activity tracker;score fusion;neural network","Correlation;Knowledge based systems;Authentication;Sensors;Proposals;Task analysis;Wireless fidelity","","","","","","43","IEEE","10 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, utilizing WiFi signals to implement intelligent sensing applications is an inevitable trend. In WiFi sensing applications, through-the-wall crowd counting is a challenging problem. In the through-the-wall scenario, the wireless signal transmitted through the wall will carry a lot of noises and is severely attenuated. Therefore, the influence of human activities on the wireless signal is difficult to extract. To solve this problem, we propose TWCC, a through-the-wall crowd counting system using ambient WiFi signals. TWCC utilizes commercial WiFi equipments to extract the phase difference data of the channel state information (CSI) and transform it to sense the environment. First, TWCC preprocesses the data to remove uncorrelated noise, and then combines the subcarrier correlation to achieve through-the-wall human detection. When people exist, TWCC extracts features from four domains as feature groups, namely time domain, subcarrier domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain. Then TWCC uses different backpropagation (BP) neural networks for the features of the four domains and combines with weighting and threshold judgment to realize the through-the-wall crowd counting detection. Extensive real-world experiments show that TWCC achieves an average recognition accuracy of about 90% and maintains strong robustness to different speeds and environments.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2022.3140305","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61932013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678075","WiFi sensing;Through-the-wall Sensing;Crowd counting detection;Channel state information","Feature extraction;Wireless fidelity;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Sensors;Data mining;Personnel","","","","","","","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

There are not many studies analyzing energy consumption of existing localization systems, even though it is an important factor in real applications. In this paper, both energy consumption and accuracy are analyzed, having an energy consumption of only 0.8 Wh (having a 3.7 V battery) during a 24-hour cycle and an average localization error of 4.51 meters.

One of the new features, mentioned as the Restricted Access Window (RAW), focuses on enhancing scalability in extremely dense deployments. RAW divides stations into groups and reduces contention and collisions by permitting channel access to one group at a time. However, the standard does not mandate any optimum RAW grouping strategy. Existing station grouping schemes for enhanced throughput and Quality of Service (QoS) considered a fixed number of groups, though it is one of the important factors in determining the overall throughput. In this paper, we have proposed a real-time grouping scheme non-constrained on the number of groups for homogeneous periodic traffic with the same QoS. The proposed scheme uses Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering for station grouping where fairness and throughput are used as metrics for distance measure and level selection. Level throughput is estimated from its clusters(groups), using a Neural Network regressor with a 3-dimensional input vector. Evaluation of the network is done after every beacon interval and optimum station grouping and group parameters are broadcasted before the start of a next beacon interval. The proposed model was tested against uniform grouping and random grouping, an improvement of 20%, and 50% in the normalized throughput was observed.

At present, most of the currently available Wi-Fi indoor localization techniques focus on increasing the localization accuracy. However, few of them take into account the diversity of Wi-Fi signal distributions and the measurement error associated with RSS values owing to the complicated indoor environment, which consequently results in the low robustness of indoor localization systems. Thus, with the motivation to tackle this gripping problem, we design a new hybrid hypothesis test based on the idea of Asymptotic Relative Efficiency (ARE), which exploits signal distributions by considering different Access Point (AP) contributions to the Wi-Fi indoor localization accuracy. In concrete terms, first of all, the Jarque-Bera (JB) test is used to perform the normality test on the Wi-Fi signal distribution at each Reference Point (RP), and then the Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) approach is applied to obtain each AP contribution degree. Secondly, based on the evaluation of the JB test on the Wi-Fi signal distribution, the hybrid Mann-Whitney U and T test is applied to find the set of matching RPs corresponding to each newly-collected RSS data. Finally, the target location estimate is acquired by using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), where the contribution degree of each AP is assigned as the weight during the calculation to find matching RPs. From the extensive experimental results, it is evident that the proposed approach can successfully improve the system performance by achieving a higher localization accuracy and enhanced robustness when compared with the state-of-the-art Wi-Fi indoor localization techniques.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2021.3076269","Science and Technology Research Project of Chongqing Education Commission(grant numbers:KJZD-K202000605); Chongqing Natural Science Foundation Project(grant numbers:cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0842,cstc2020jcyj-msxmX0865); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61901076); Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in the University(grant numbers:IRT1299); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417739","Wi-Fi indoor localization;Jarque-Bera test;hybrid Mann-Whitney U and T test;asymptotic relative efficiency;Chi-squared automatic interaction detection","Location awareness;Wireless fidelity;Databases;Indoor environment;Robustness;Channel models;Fading channels","indoor communication;indoor radio;nearest neighbour methods;RSSI;signal processing;statistical testing;wireless LAN","k-nearest neighbor;hybrid Mann-Whitney U-T test;CHAID;chi-squared automatic interaction detection;Jarque-Bera test;asymptotic relative efficiency;RSS values;measurement error;integrated statistical test;access point contributions;received signal strength;Wi-Fi networks;higher localization accuracy;Wi-Fi indoor localization accuracy;signal distributions;indoor localization systems;complicated indoor environment;Wi-Fi signal distribution","","44","","46","IEEE","28 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, wireless technology can be used for localization in indoor venues, which does not require direct line of sight communication. Wi-Fi based indoor location systems can achieve low cost and high accuracy at the same time. The most widely used methods in indoor environments based on Wi-Fi are Trilateration technique and Location Fingerprint (LF) technique. Trilateration technique is more noise sensitive than LF technique, while the accuracy of Location Fingerprint technique is greatly affected by a change in environment.

Furthermore, unlike recent work using Doppler shifts based on Wi-Fi Radar, the proposed method can be achieved only by Wi-Fi transmissions between a transmitter and a receiver, which can transmit the information and recognize gesture simultaneously. We evaluate the proposed method using Sora platform in an office environment, with a human subject performing eight different gestures. The type of the gestures performed between the transmitter and receiver of Sora platform can have significant effects on the received Wi-Fi signals. From these time varying signals, we extract features that are representative of the gesture types based on 1-D diagonal slice of fourth-order cumulants within a sliding time window.

There also exist many other problems, such as positioning stability and blind spots, which can cause decline in positioning accuracy at certain positions, or even failure of positioning. However, it will increase the hardware cost by adding more static APs; if the localization mechanism integrates different wireless signals is adopted, it tends to cause high cost of positioning and long complex positioning process, etc. In this paper, we proposed a novel hybrid Wi-Fi access point-based localization algorithm (HAPLA), which utilizes the received signal strength indications (RSSI) from static APs and dynamic APs to determine location scenes. It flexibly selects available AP signals and dynamically switches the positioning methods, thus to achieve efficient positioning. HAPLA only relies on the Wi-Fi signal strength values, which can reduce the cost of hardware and the complexity of localization system. The proposed method can also be able to effectively prevent interference from different signal sources. In our test scenario, we deployed typical indoor scenes with the NLOS factors and the multipath effect for experiments. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method and the results show that, compared with the classic K nearest neighbor-based location algorithm (KNN) and the variance-based fingerprint distance adjustment algorithm (VFDA), HAPLA has better adaptability and higher positioning accuracy, and can effectively solve the problem of positioning blind spots.","2471-917X","978-1-5090-6299-7","10.1109/IPIN.2017.8115924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8115924","indoor localization;hybrid Wi-Fi access points;fingerprint;triangulation localization;trilateration localization","","indoor radio;radionavigation;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","indoor localization algorithms;wireless signals;hybrid Wi-Fi access point-based localization algorithm;received signal strength indications;complex positioning process;localization mechanism;positioning stability;wireless access points;Wi-Fi signals;hybrid Wi-Fi hotspots;blind spots;higher positioning accuracy;fingerprint distance adjustment algorithm;location algorithm;multipath effect;NLOS factors;localization system;Wi-Fi signal strength values;HAPLA;positioning methods","","3","","27","","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Particularly, we focus on two kinds of sensing modes: finger tracking recovers the moving trace of finger writings; multi-touch gesture recognition identifies the multi-touch gestures involving multiple fingers. Specifically, we build a theoretical model to extract the fine-grained reflection feature from the raw RF -signal, which describes the finger influence on the tag array in cm- level resolution. For the finger tracking, we leverage K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to pinpoint the finger position relying on the fine-grained reflection features, and obtain a smoothed trace via Kalman filter. Additionally, we construct the reflection image of each multi-touch gesture from the reflection features by regarding the multiple fingers as a whole. Finally, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the multi-touch gestures based on the images.

To maneuver indoors these robots need to be aware of their situation within each room and the objects within. It's no longer acceptable for a robot to use just pulses for collision avoidance; it must interact with static (non-moving) objects, too. Today we have a large array of imaging methods being visible light imaging, thermal imaging, night-vision imaging, but we need imaging in other cases such as a smoke-filled area containing same temperature objects. To see static objects in this arena, this research introduces Wi-Fi static object imaging and classification. It will allow a robot to maneuver a room with static objects when these other imaging methods won't work well. This involves many challenges. The images created will be barely identifiable due to the low resolution of Wi-Fi, but the images need to be classified (identified). There are two major portions to this research. The first is the signal processing portion, where images are created, and the second is the image classification portion. In the signal processing portion, images will be created by using Wi-Fi signals transmitted and received on Ettus Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) hardware and directional antennas. These USRP's are interfaced to GNU Radio for which the researchers have developed specialized routines to implement this portion of the research. In the image classification phase, the images created will be very blob-like with different reflective intensities. These images need some form of intelligence to classify them, and the system needs to improve its classification over time. AI neural networks will be employed and developed to work on the images. This research is a work-in-progress where the signal processing portion is complete except for further tuning. The images created so far have very distinct characteristics.

Since visible light communication mainly depends on the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission, it is susceptible to channel blockage, which should be considered by users to select the appropriate type of network access. In the existing literature, LiFi channel blockage parameters are regarded as known for users to determine the access type. However, in practical scenarios, the estimation of blockage parameters lags behind their variations, and users can not get the real-time blockage information. In this paper, a support-vector-machine- based (SVM-based) network access type decision scheme is proposed in hybrid LiFi and WiFi networks. By taking the correlation of blockage parameters between adjacent periods into account, SVM is adopted to achieve high equivalent data rate when accurate blockage parameters are unknown. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the considered benchmarks under different scenarios in terms of the equivalent data rate performance.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-1220-6","10.1109/VTCFall.2019.8891341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891341","","Light fidelity;Wireless fidelity;Support vector machines;Handover;Training;Optical receivers","free-space optical communication;indoor communication;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","SVM-based network access type decision;wireless fidelity;visible light communication;LiFi channel blockage parameters;hybrid LiFi-WiFi network;light fidelity;support vector machine based network access type decision scheme;blockage parameters correlation","","2","","17","","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this random RU selection lead to a high collision rate, consequently degrading throughput and increasing latency. This paper proposes a distributed RU selection method using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based Deep Reinforcement Learning (C-DRL) to improve throughput and latency of a wireless network. Specifically, each station locally trains its CNN in an online manner on the basis of energy detection and acknowledgment packets. To reach a steady-state faster, we propose the Greedy Experience Replay (GER) algorithm, in which stations also learn from the non-selected RUs by hypothetically generating their outcomes in hindsight. Notably, the C-DRL RU selection does not require any centralized training or packet exchanges amongst the stations to ensure fair resource distribution. Further C-DRL stations can coexist with standard 802.11ax stations and still improve overall network performance. Comprehensive simulations were conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed C-DRL method. The results show a 112.7% higher average throughput and 73.5% lower average latency than standard 802.11ax medium access control (MAC) for a single access point network (ten stations).","1938-1883","978-1-7281-7122-7","10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500628","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9500628","","Training;Wireless LAN;Wireless networks;OFDM;IEEE 802.11ax Standard;Reinforcement learning;Throughput","convolutional neural nets;frequency division multiple access;learning (artificial intelligence);OFDM modulation;wireless LAN","distributed Convolutional Deep Reinforcement;OFDMA MAC;IEEE 802.11ax;Wi-Fi 6;multiuser Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access;up-link communication;packet transmission opportunities;available sub-channel;called Resource Unit;random RU selection lead;high collision rate;distributed RU selection method;convolutional neural network;CNN;wireless network;energy detection;acknowledgment packets;C-DRL RU selection;centralized training;fair resource distribution;C-DRL stations;802.11ax stations;network performance;C-DRL method;higher average throughput;802.11ax medium access control;single access point network;ten stations;greedy experience replay algorithm","","","","21","","6 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DANGR applies wavelet transformation for amplitude denoising, and conjugate calibration to remove CSI time-variant random phase offsets. A Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based data augmentation approach is proposed to reduce the large consumptions of data collection and the over-fitting risks caused by incomplete dataset. The distribution of CSI in various environments may be biased. In order to shrink these domains discrepancies in environments, we adopt domain adaptation based on multikernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy scheme, which matches the mean-embeddings of abstract representations across domains in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

Traditional HAR systems mostly leverage a single sensing modality (e.g., either wearable, vision, or radio frequency sensing) combined with machine learning techniques to recognize human activities. Such unimodal HAR systems do not cope well with real-time changes in the environment. To overcome this limitation, new HAR systems that incorporate multiple sensing modalities are needed. Multiple diverse sensors can provide more accurate and complete information resulting in better recognition of the performed activities. This article presents WiWeHAR-a multimodal HAR system that uses combined Wi-Fi and wearable sensing modalities to simultaneously sense the performed activities. WiWeHAR makes use of standard Wi-Fi network interface cards to collect the channel state information (CSI) and a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer sensors to collect the user's local body movements. We compute the time-variant mean Doppler shift (MDS) from the processed CSI data and magnitude from the inertial data for each sensor of the IMU. Thereafter, we separately extract various time- and frequency-domain features from the magnitude data and the MDS. We apply feature-level fusion to combine the extracted features, and finally supervised learning techniques are used to recognize the performed activities. We evaluate the performance of WiWeHAR by using a multimodal human activity data set, which was obtained from 9 participants. Each participant carried out four activities, such as walking, falling, sitting, and picking up an object from the floor.

Compared with the RSS, the Channel State Information (CSI) can provide the multi-channel subcarrier phase and amplitude information to better describe the signal propagation path. Thus, the CSI becomes one of the most commonly used signal features in indoor Wi-Fi localization. Compared to the CSI-based geometric localization method, the fingerprint-based localization method has advantages of easy implementation and high accuracy. Based on this, this paper proposes an indoor CSI fingerprint localization approach based on tensor decomposition. Specifically, we combine the tensor decomposition algorithm based on the Parallel Factor (PARAFAC) analysis model with the Alternating Least Squares (ALS) iterative algorithm to reduce the interference of the environment.

Therefore, to address above issue, this paper proposes a Lightweight Mobile Temporal Convolution Network (LM-TCN). On the one hand, the proposed approach uses the fully 1-D convolution framework to provide time-shift invariant inductive bias. On the other hand, the combination of invert bottleneck and gated mechanism optimizes the computational load of the conventional residual structure to prevent overfitting under few training samples. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed LM-TCN is 95.2% across all 24 predefined locations, which is 2.9% higher than the baseline TCN while the calculation cost is reduced to 6% of TCN.

While securing the car's interfaces to the outside world is an important part of mitigating this threat, the last line of defence is detecting malicious behaviour on the CAN bus. We propose an anomaly detector based on a Long Short-Term Memory neural network to detect CAN bus attacks. The detector works by learning to predict the next data word originating from each sender on the bus. Highly surprising bits in the actual next word are flagged as anomalies. We evaluate the detector by synthesizing anomalies with modified CAN bus data. The synthesized anomalies are designed to mimic attacks reported in the literature. We show that the detector can detect anomalies we synthesized with low false alarm rates. Additionally, the granularity of the bit predictions can provide forensic investigators clues as to the nature of flagged anomalies.","","978-1-5090-5206-6","10.1109/DSAA.2016.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7796898","Anomaly detection;Controller area network;Automotive;LSTM","Automobiles;Detectors;Context;Timing;Clocks;Dictionaries","automotive electronics;computer crime;computer network security;controller area networks;field buses;neural nets","anomaly detection;automobile control network data;hacking;controller area network bus;threat mitigation;malicious behaviour detection;long short-term memory neural network;CAN bus attack detection;false alarm rates;forensic investigators","","160","2","23","","26 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, indoor location sensing is mostly achieved by measuring radio signal (WiFi, Bluetooth, GSM etc.) strength and nearest neighbor identification. The algorithm that is most commonly used for Received Signal Strength (RSS) based location detection is the K Nearest Neighbor (KNN). KNN algorithm identifies an estimate location using the K nearest neighboring points. Accordingly, in this paper, we aim to improve the KNN algorithm by integrating a short term memory (STM) where past signal strength readings are stored. Considering the limited movement capabilities of a mobile user in an indoor environment, user's previous locations can be taken into consideration to derive his/her current position. Hence, in the proposed approach, the signal strength readings are refined with the historical data prior to comparison with the environment's radio map.

For example, the 6 GHz rules created different power regimes for unlicensed devices to protect incumbents: “indoor” devices, subject to lower transmit powers but not required to access an Automatic Frequency Control database to obtain permission to use a channel, and “outdoor” devices, allowed to transmit at higher power but required to do so to determine channel availability. However, since there are no reliable means of determining if a wireless device is indoors or outdoors, other restrictions were mandated: reduced power for client devices and indoor access points that cannot be battery powered, have detachable antennas or be weatherized. These constraints lead to sub-optimal spectrum usage and potential for misuse. Hence, there is a need for robust identification of device environments to enable spectrum sharing. In this paper we study automatic indoor/outdoor classification based on the radio frequency (RF) environment experienced by a device. Using a custom Android app, we first create a labeled data set of a number of parameters of Wi-Fi and cellular signals in various indoor and outdoor environments, and then evaluate the classification performance of various machine learning (ML) models on this data set.

However, limited by the hardware imperfection, realizing a training-free DFT system using the commodity Wi-Fi is still a challenging task to solve. To address this issue, we develop a novel DFT system which can track the target motion via both target velocity and AOA estimations simultaneously. First, the motion-induced phase shifts are refined from extremely noisy channel state information (CSI) measurements to detect the Doppler shift based on the signal superposition analysis. Then, according to the phased-array signal processing, we realize joint Doppler velocity and AOA estimation of the target path under the compressive sensing framework. It formulates joint Doppler velocity and AOA estimation as a two-dimensional sparse reconstruction problem, which can achieve a high accuracy to further estimate the target velocity and track the target motion at a decimeter level.

We then design a complete RL framework and call into question whether the use of complex RL algorithms helps the quest for rapid learning in realistic scenarios. Through extensive simulations, we derive that stateless RL in the form of lightweight multi-armed-bandits (MABs) is an efficient solution for rapid adaptation avoiding the definition of broad and/or meaningless states. In contrast to most current trends, we envision lightweight MABs as an appropriate alternative to the cumbersome and slowly convergent methods such as Q-learning, and especially, deep reinforcement learning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3114430","Cisco, Machine Learning for Wireless Networking in Highly Dynamic Scenarios (WINDMAL)(grant numbers:PGC2018-099959-B-I00 [Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (MCIU)/Agencia Estatal de Innovación (AEI)/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional (FEDER), Union Europea (UE)],SGR-2017-1188); ECSEL Joint Undertaking (JU) through the Intelligent Secure Trustable Things (InSecTT) Project(grant numbers:876038); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9543682","Channel bonding;spectrum allocation;multi-agent;reinforcement learning;multi-armed bandit","Bonding;Radio spectrum management;Interference;Switches;Bandwidth;Wireless networks;Toy manufacturing industry","deep learning (artificial intelligence);radio spectrum management;wireless LAN","multiarmed bandits;spectrum allocation;multiagent channel bonding WLANs;dynamic channel bonding;wireless local area networks;primary channel selection;secondary channel selection;multiple basic service sets;hand-crafted spectrum management techniques;Wi-Fi environments;machine learning;model-free RL suits;complex RL algorithms;rapid learning;stateless RL;deep reinforcement learning;uncoordinated high-density deployments;complex hidden-exposed node interactions","","","","39","CCBY","22 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the technological challenges related to this is to provide Quality of Services (QoS)-enabled network connectivity to the applications. Diverse QoS demands from the applications intimidate the underlying wireless networks to be agile and adaptive. Since the applications are diverse in nature, there must be a mechanism to learn the application types in near real-time so that the network can be provisioned accordingly. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning (ML) based method to classify the application traffic. Our method is different from the existing port based and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) based methods and uses statistical features of the network traffic related to the applications.

For infrastructure-based people counting, Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) has attracted attention as it does not require any additional deployment. However, the existing approaches assume multiple fixed infrastructures such as Wi-Fi access points (APs), which is different from standard AP deployment since they are installed for wireless network services. To solve this problem, our goal is to estimate the number of people (i.e. people counting) by using mobile devices such as smartphones and a small number of fixed APs. Since CSI represents the difference between the amplitude and the phase of the transmitted and received radio waves, we can estimate the change of the propagation environment from CSI. However, CSI is very noisy due to various factors that are not related to the number of people. In this paper, we focus on Sampling Frequency Offset (SFO), Carrier Frequency Offset (CFO), A/D Converter (ADC) delay, and quantization error, and design methods to mitigate their effects. Then, we propose people counting by using CSI variance as a location-independent feature for machine learning. From the evaluation results, we have confirmed that our method achieves the Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) of 0.49, which is much better than RMSE of 3.7 without denoising.","","978-1-7281-4716-1","10.1109/PerComWorkshops48775.2020.9156098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9156098","Channel State Information;CSI;Wi-Fi;People Counting;Mobile Sensing","Receivers;Quantization (signal);Wireless fidelity;Delays;Mobile handsets;Analog-digital conversion;Radio transmitters","analogue-digital conversion;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;mobile computing;radiowave propagation;smart phones;wireless channels;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi CSI;mobile devices;monitoring crowdedness;public spaces;shopping malls;evacuation planning;infrastructure-based people;Wi-Fi Channel State Information;additional deployment;multiple fixed infrastructures;Wi-Fi access points;standard AP deployment;wireless network services;Sampling Frequency Offset;Carrier Frequency Offset;CSI variance","","1","","12","","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our method allows a novel teacher network trained in the server to distill the knowledge for a student network running in the edge device, which is achieved by a cross-domain distillation. Leveraging unlabeled data in the new environment, our student model amends the feature learning to be domain invariant, then being our objective model running in the edge device.

However, most of the existing weighted k-nearest neighbor (WKNN) algorithms use the Euclidean distance of received signal strengths (RSS) as distance measure for fingerprint matching, and the RSS Euclidean distance is not consistent with the position distance. To address this issue, this paper analyzes the relationship between RSS similarity and position distance, propose a novel WKNN based on signal similarity and spatial position. Firstly, we obtain the weighted Euclidean distance (WED) by balancing the size between the RSS difference and the signal propagation distance difference according to the attenuation law of the spatial signal. Then, we obtain the approximate position distance (APD) by making full use of the position distances and WEDs between RPs. Finally, the nearest RPs can be selected more accurately based on the APDs between the user and different RPs, and the position of user can be estimated by the proposed WKNN based on the APD (APD-WKNN) algorithm. In order to fully evaluate the proposed algorithm, we use three fingerprint databases for comparison experiments with eight fingerprint positioning algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the positioning accuracy of WKNN algorithm.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2973212","National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0502100,2016YFB0502103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8993814","Fingerprint positioning;weighted k-nearest neighbor;RSS similarity;position distance","Euclidean distance;Wireless fidelity;Signal processing algorithms;Attenuation;Fingerprint recognition;Position measurement;Avalanche photodiodes","nearest neighbour methods;RSSI;wireless LAN","WKNN algorithm;novel weighted KNN algorithm;RSS similarity;Wi-Fi Fingerprint Positioning;distance relationship;distance measure;RSS Euclidean distance;signal similarity;spatial position;weighted Euclidean distance;RSS difference;signal propagation distance difference;approximate position distance;APD algorithm;fingerprint positioning algorithms;positioning accuracy;fingerprint matching;weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithms;reference points","","26","","26","CCBY","11 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Their built-in WiFi capability makes WiFi-based approaches essential for a range of indoor positioning applications. In such LBS systems, accessing received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and finer-grained channel state information (CSI) is enabled by modifying commodity WiFi devices. Additionally, multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) provide the spatial and frequency diversity to build the fingerprint database with CSI. However, due to hardware and environmental impacts, such systems suffer from phase errors and fingerprint noise. In this paper, a novel phase calibration method is proposed to reduce the fingerprint noise and improve the accuracy of CSI-based indoor positioning systems. The CSI phase of each subcarrier is extracted from the WiFi access points in a multi-antenna wireless network. First, the phase offset is calculated through the conventional method that uses a linear transformation to remove phase errors. Then, a dynamic phase calibration method is introduced to compensate for the phase offset by tracking the anomalous phase difference between each CSI sample and neighboring subcarrier. Finally, a machine learning algorithm is trained to estimate the target position. The performance of the proposed algorithm is investigated by evaluating the prediction rate from a margin of error (MoE) model and calculating the average distance error between the predicted grid and ground truth. Experimental results show the dynamic phase calibration method outperforms the conventional linear transformation calibration method by a higher prediction rate and improves the average position accuracy.","","978-1-6654-1490-6","10.1109/CCWC51732.2021.9376003","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9376003","Channel state information;device-free;fingerprinting;indoor positioning;phase calibration","Machine learning algorithms;Conferences;Fingerprint recognition;Predictive models;Calibration;Received signal strength indicator;Wireless fidelity","calibration;indoor radio;location based services;MIMO communication;OFDM modulation;RSSI;wireless LAN","phase errors;dynamic phase calibration method;anomalous phase difference;conventional linear transformation calibration method;average position accuracy;location-based services;WiFi capability;WiFi-based approaches;LBS systems;received signal strength indicator;fingerprint noise;CSI-based indoor positioning systems;CSI phase;WiFi access points;multiantenna wireless network","","","","25","","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, to build a probability map from noisy Received Signal Strength (RSS), a Gaussian Process (GP) regression is deployed to estimate and construct the RSS fingerprints with incomplete data. Mean and variance of generated points are used to estimate WiFi fingerprinting position by K-nearest weights from the probability of visible RSS measurements of the online phase. In addition, a particle filter is applied to fuse PDR and WiFi fingerprinting by using the information from RSS, inertial sensors and features of indoor maps. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework, two case studies are considered. In the first case, a comparison is made between GP regression with K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) method to show the improvement with a sparse input data set. In the second case, the proposed framework is compared to both the fingerprinting approach as well as the PDR algorithm. The results show significant improvements from our proposed framework.

They operate in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band that is shared by different technologies, such as Bluetooth and WiFi, which add interference at higher transmission power. For this reason, interference is an important factor to avoid for reliable communications. Due to the unpredictable nature of the wireless medium, the 802.15.4e standard has introduced the possibility to schedule a channel in frequency using Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), but the selection of the optimal channel is still an ongoing research. In this paper, a Multilayered Feedforward Neural Network (MFNN) is proposed as a possible solution to make predictions about which channel can offer low latency and high throughput at any given time slot. Controlled experiments were conducted in an anechoic chamber, considering the two scenarios of no interference and interference incurred by other sensors and WiFi. Results show that MFNN is a valid solution, obtaining performance comparable to the best case scenario.","","978-1-5090-4429-0","10.1109/ICNSC.2017.8000192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8000192","","Wireless sensor networks;Neurons;Interference;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Probes;Measurement;Biological neural networks","anechoic chambers (acoustic);cognitive radio;telecommunication network reliability;wireless channels;wireless sensor networks","cognitive channel selection;wireless sensor communications;wireless sensor networks;WSN;interference;higher transmission power;reliable communications;wireless medium;time division multiple access;TDMA;optimal channel;multilayered feedforward neural network;MFNN;anechoic chamber","","4","","23","","3 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current indoor WiFi signal access point (AP) deployment has been very dense, which ensures a wide coverage of WiFi signal. However, AP deployment in indoor environments is often irregular, with a large number of redundant nodes, and the complex indoor environment can also have an impact on signal propagation, which greatly reduces the accuracy of WiFi positioning and increases the time and space overhead in the calculation process. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a comprehensive AP selection method using Loss Rate (LR) and Signal Stability to measure the fluctuation of signal continuity and Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) of each AP, respectively, and validate it in the online stage using an improved fingerprint matching algorithm. In the offline stage, the APs with relatively continuous signal sources are filtered out by calculating LR, followed by calculating the signal stability of each AP at each sampling point and filtering out the APs with less fluctuation in RSSI values. In the online stage, the RSSI collected from the test point is matched with KNN (K Nearest Neighbor) and WKNN (Weighted K Nearest Neighbor) for localization, and the Manhattan distance is introduced to replace the Euclidean distance to finally obtain the test point localization results. The experimental environment of this paper is the ninth floor of the research building of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. The experimental results show that the AP comprehensive selection method is used to achieve the optimization of AP combination, and the localization performance is evaluated by the improved WKNN localization algorithm, and it is found that the localization accuracy of this paper's algorithm is significantly improved. The localization accuracy can reach 1.18m in 60% of the range, which is 39.2% better than 1.94m of MaxMean AP selection method and 4.8% better than 1.24m of the traditional WKNN algorithm.","2770-4254","978-1-6654-2605-3","10.1109/IDAACS53288.2021.9660916","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9660916","indoor positioning;WiFi;fingerprint;access points selection;Loss Rate;Manhattan distance","Location awareness;Matched filters;Fluctuations;Loss measurement;Indoor environment;Telecommunications;Received signal strength indicator","","","","","","9","","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Federated learning provides a compelling framework for learning models from decentralized data, but conventionally, it assumes the availability of labeled samples, whereas on-device data are generally either unlabeled or cannot be annotated readily through user interaction. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised approach termed scalogram-signal correspondence learning based on wavelet transform (WT) to learn useful representations from unlabeled sensor inputs as electroencephalography, blood volume pulse, accelerometer, and WiFi channel-state information. Our auxiliary task requires a deep temporal neural network to determine if a given pair of a signal and its complementary view (i.e., a scalogram generated with WT) align with each other, by optimizing a contrastive objective. We extensively assess the quality of learned features with our multiview strategy on diverse public data sets, achieving strong performance in all domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of representations learned from an unlabeled input collection on downstream tasks with training a linear classifier over pretrained network, usefulness in low-data regime, transfer learning, and cross-validation. Our methodology achieves competitive performance with fully supervised networks and it works significantly better than pretraining with autoencoders in both central and federated contexts. Notably, it improves the generalization in a semisupervised setting as it reduces the volume of labeled data required through leveraging self-supervised learning.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3009358","SCOTT (www.scott-project.eu) Project; Electronic Component Systems for European Leadership Joint Undertaking(grant numbers:737422); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme and Austria, Spain, Finland, Ireland, Sweden, Germany, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9141293","Deep learning;embedded intelligence;federated learning;learning representations;low-data regime;self-supervised learning;sensor analytics","Brain modeling;Task analysis;Data models;Internet of Things;Wavelet transforms;Sleep","neural nets;pattern classification;sensor fusion;supervised learning;wavelet transforms","on-device data;user interaction;self-supervised approach;scalogram-signal correspondence;unlabeled sensor inputs;blood volume pulse;WiFi channel-state information;auxiliary task;deep temporal neural network;diverse public data sets;unlabeled input collection;downstream tasks;pretrained network;low-data regime;transfer learning;fully supervised networks;central contexts;federated self-supervised learning;multisensor representations;embedded intelligence;Internet-of-Things devices;centralized repository;supervised models;bandwidth limitations;federated learning;compelling framework;decentralized data","","13","","54","IEEE","15 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, this paper reviews general behavior recognition applications using the WiFi signal and presents the basic concept of CSI and the fundamental principle of CSI-based behavior recognition. This paper analyzes the key components and core characteristics of the system architecture of human behavior recognition using CSI. Afterward, we divide the sensing procedures into many steps and summarize the typical studies from these steps, including base signal selection, signal preprocessing, and identification approaches. Next, based on the recognition technique, we classify the applications into three groups, including pattern-based, model-based, and deep learning-based approach. In every group, we categorize the state-of-the-art applications into three groups, including coarse-grained specific behavior recognition, fine-grained specific behavior recognition, and activity inference. It elaborates the typical behavior recognition applications from five aspects, including experimental equipment, experimental scenario, behavior, classifier, and system performance.

The frequency diverse and temporally stable CSI better represents the location-dependent channel characteristics than the coarse received signal strength (RSS). However, the acquisition of CSI requires the cooperation of access points (APs) and involves only data frames, which imposes restrictions on real-world deployment. In this article, we present CRISLoc, the first CSI fingerprinting-based localization prototype system using ubiquitous smartphones. CRISLoc operates in a completely passive mode, overhearing the packets on-the-fly for his own CSI acquisition. The smartphone CSI is sanitized via calibrating the distortion enforced by WiFi amplifier circuits. CRISLoc tackles the challenge of altered APs with a joint clustering and outlier detection method to find them. A novel transfer learning approach is proposed to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI fingerprint database on the basis of the outdated fingerprints and a few fresh measurements, and an enhanced KNN approach is proposed to pinpoint the location of a smartphone. Our study reveals important properties about the stability and sensitivity of smartphone CSI that has not been reported previously. Experimental results show that CRISLoc can achieve a mean error of around 0.29 m in a 6 m × 8 m research laboratory. The mean error increases by 5.4 and 8.6 cm upon the movement of one and two APs, which validates the robustness of CRISLoc against environmental changes.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2020.3022573","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772139,11974082); Shanghai–Hong Kong Collaborative Project(grant numbers:18510760900); Key-Area Research and Developement Program of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2020B010166003); Yiwu Research Institute of Fudan University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9187854","Channel-state information (CSI);fingerprinting;localization;smartphone;transfer learning","Wireless fidelity;Databases;Tools;Distortion measurement;Machine learning;Gain control","indoor navigation;indoor radio;nearest neighbour methods;smart phones;telecommunication computing;wireless channels;wireless LAN","CRISLoc;smartphone CSI;WiFi amplifier circuits;outlier detection method;high-dimensional CSI fingerprint database;reconstructable CSI fingerprinting;indoor smartphone localization;WIFI indoor localization;location-dependent channel characteristics;coarse received signal strength;CSI fingerprinting-based localization prototype system;ubiquitous smartphones;coarse RSS;channel-state information-based fingerprinting;joint clustering method;access point cooperation;KNN approach","","8","","47","IEEE","8 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

How can we accurately predict who that author might be when the message may never exceed 140 characters on a service like Twitter? For the past 50 years, linguists, computer scientists, and scholars of the humanities have been jointly developing automated methods to identify authors based on the style of their writing. All authors possess peculiarities of habit that influence the form and content of their written works. These characteristics can often be quantified and measured using machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the methods of authorship attribution that can be applied to the problem of social media forensics. Furthermore, we examine emerging supervised learning-based methods that are effective for small sample sizes, and provide step-by-step explanations for several scalable approaches as instructional case studies for newcomers to the field.

At present, many complex scenarios for indoor localization require position estimation not only in single-floor environments but also in multifloor ones. However, existing works exhibit certain limitations in solving the problems that involve high computational complexity and floor localization accuracy. In this paper, a multifloor identification system based on WiFi fingerprint database is designed to address these issues. This floor identification system is divided into offline and online phases. In the offline phase, a localization fingerprint database is built based on WiFi nodes and a multifloor identification model is proposed based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA), called MA_LDA. In the online phase, the final floor number is determined, and the trained model is combined with the majority voting mechanism. After determining the floor number, an algorithm based on the k-nearest neighbor (KNN), called LL_KNN, is proposed to obtain the location information of a target on the floor. Real experiment results show that our system can identify the floor number by using only a little WiFi node fingerprint information rather than all the nodes to reduce the computational complexity. It works efficiently and achieves high fault-tolerance performance compared with existing approaches in locating targets in a multifloor environment.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2019.2912055","Hunan Province(grant numbers:2017GK2030); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61672220); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693854","Indoor localization;multiclassification;multifloor determination;wireless network","Wireless fidelity;Computational complexity;Databases;Computational modeling;Buildings;Wireless sensor networks;Training","computational complexity;linear discriminant analysis;nearest neighbour methods;wireless LAN","floor identification system;localization fingerprint database;WiFi nodes;multifloor identification model;final floor number;location information;WiFi node fingerprint information;multifloor environment;indoor multifloor localization method;indoor location-based services;position estimation;single-floor environments;floor localization accuracy;multifloor identification system;WiFi fingerprint database;computational complexity;LL_KNN;MA_LDA;linear discriminant analysis;majority voting mechanism;k-nearest neighbor;fault-tolerance performance","","14","","30","IEEE","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Any truly resilient communications protocol must be capable of immediate redeployment to meet quality of service (QoS) demands in a wide variety of possible channel media. This work proposes an approach to communications that is contrary to much traditional approaches in that processing blocks are generated real-time and only relevant to the particular channel medium being used. Rather than creating man-made ubiquitous blocks of signal processing, we examine using processing that is immediately expendable once it has been used. This is achieved through software-defined radios, and deep modulation, where system blocks are replaced with machine learning graphs that can be trained, used, and then discarded as needed. Simulation and experimental hardware show how deep modulation can converge to viable communications links, using the same machine intelligence, in vastly different channels.","2155-7586","978-1-5386-7185-6","10.1109/MILCOM.2018.8599807","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8599807","physical layer;machine learning;digital communications;tactical networks","Machine learning;Wireless communication;Protocols;Peer-to-peer computing;Modulation;Digital communication;Wireless sensor networks","learning (artificial intelligence);military communication;modems;quality of service;software radio;WiMax;wireless channels;wireless LAN","over-the-air trainable machine modem;WiMax;tactical communications;wireless communication technology;physical layers;man-made ubiquitous blocks;signal processing;deep modulation;machine intelligence;physical layer protocols;communications links;PHY layer communications","","6","","32","","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, focusing on Random Forest (RF) machine learning models, we study the effects of various feature sets (e.g., IPs and ports) on the detection accuracy for different attacks. Moreover, the effects of RF configurations (i.e., forest size and tree depth) on the detection accuracy and run-time overheads are also evaluated. In addition to our collected datasets, two known IoT datasets were also used. The results show that RF can achieve high detection accuracy with the selected feature sets for the considered attacks. Moreover, the detection accuracy of RF decreases only slightly with reduced forest sizes (e.g., fewer trees or less depth) where the run-time overheads can be significantly reduced.

Based on real waveforms emitted by a WiFi access point (AP) and collected by a RF sensor, we demonstrate that anomaly detection, e.g., represented by the presence of a person in the monitored area, is possible. The proposed methodology, tested in a typical office environment when the AP-sensor link is in non-line-of-sight (NLOS), achieves an accuracy greater than 95% just by collecting few beacon packets, i.e., in dozens of milliseconds. Moreover, results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms a well-known received signal strength (RSS)-based solution in terms of accuracy, even using just a single sensor.","","978-1-7281-2194-9","10.1109/ICSPCS47537.2019.9008700","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9008700","","Radio frequency;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Anomaly detection;Indoor environments;Wireless fidelity;Training","indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);security;signal detection;wireless LAN","ambient intelligence;SoOp;ML techniques;indoor environment;WiFi access point;RF sensor;monitored area;office environment;AP-sensor link;nonline-of-sight link;signal strength-based solution;anomaly detection;indoor areas;WiFi signals of opportunity;NLOS link;change detection;radiofrequency based anomaly detector;machine learning;beacon packets;received signal strength;RSS-based solution","","9","","22","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the advent of myriads of applications from video telephony and streaming to virtual reality, network administrators face the challenge to provide high quality of experience (QoE) in the face of diverse wireless conditions and application contents. Yet, state-of-the-art networks lack analytics for QoE, as this requires support from the application or user feedback. While there are existing techniques to map quality of service (QoS) to QoE by training machine learning (ML) models without requiring user feedback, these techniques are limited to only few applications (e.g., Skype), due to insufficient QoE ground-truth annotation for ML. To address these limitations, we focus on video telephony applications and model key artefacts of spatial and temporal video QoE. Our key contribution is designing content- and device-independent metrics and training across diverse WiFi conditions. We show that our metrics achieve a median 90% accuracy by comparing with mean-opinion-score (MOS) from more than 200 users and 800 video samples. Our content-independent metrics significantly reduce the MOS prediction error of previous works and are validated over three popular video telephony applications - Skype, FaceTime and Google Hangouts.","1548-615X","978-1-5386-2542-2","10.1109/IWQoS.2018.8624138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8624138","","Quality of experience;Streaming media;Bit rate;Telephony;Discrete cosine transforms;Quality of service","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of experience;quality of service;telecommunication traffic;video signal processing;video streaming;videotelephony;wireless LAN","user feedback;map quality;machine learning models;ML;spatial video QoE;temporal video QoE;device-independent metrics;QoE ground-truth annotation;video telephony applications-Skype;application contents;diverse wireless conditions;network administrators face;virtual reality;cellular enterprise wireless networks;mobile video traffic;enterprise WiFi;video QoE modeling;scalable ground-truth annotation;content-independent metrics;diverse WiFi conditions","","","","23","","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An outlier removal algorithm is then applied to remove the outliers according to physical proximity. To obtain the optimal partitioning, an optimization algorithm is proposed and applied onto the space partitioning technique.

The AutLoc system includes an offline training phase and an online localization phase. In the offline training phase, we train the deep autoencoder to denoise the measured data and then build the RSS fingerprints according to the trained weights. In the online localization phase, we adopt three machine learning algorithms, which are random forest regression, multi-player perceptron classification and multi-player perceptron regression, to estimate the location. Averaging over the results of three algorithms, we then obtain the final estimated location.

Recently, APs are getting deployed outdoors as well, and urban canyon phenomenon degrades the capability of GPS localization even in outdoor environments, which makes RSSI localization techniques attractive as an outdoor localization solution as well. The downside of RSSI localization is that it is polarized, which means it has either high performance and economic cost or low cost and poor accuracy. Both cases are inadequate for a general deployment; high-cost algorithms can only be deployed in heavily populated area for cost feasibility and the accuracy of low-cost algorithms is nowhere near credible. In this paper, we propose a range-based RSSI localization algorithm that has reasonable accuracy yet has very low cost.

As signals from the global positioning system cannot be received inside buildings, only approximate locations can be estimated using Wi-Fi routers or cellular base station information, and exact locations cannot be determined. Therefore, a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) scheme using several sensors is suggested in this work. However, this scheme requires users to hold their smartphones in a specific manner; furthermore, user-dependent parameters, such as height and step length, are necessary because the sensor parameters vary. This study uses deep-learning algorithms to overcome the limitations of the existing smartphone-based PDR scheme. A convolutional neural network algorithm is used to classify the smartphone positions; then, appropriate sensor data are selected and adjusted. The long short-term memory algorithm is used to estimate the user step length. Although the PDR performance is enhanced using the deep-learning algorithm, accumulated error is unavoidable because the algorithm traces the relative position with reference to the original location. Therefore, optical camera communication is introduced to provide the reference location and periodically compensate for the accumulated PDR error.

Besides, it can be time-consuming to select the most discriminative feature as salient evidence. In this paper, we present a device-free number gesture recognition approach based on deep learning, named DeNum. First, we explore the sensibility of both the amplitude and phase information of de-noised CSI values to action transitions. Then the amplitude difference is utilized to detect the finishing points of actions through multiple sliding windows. To extract discriminative features from both the amplitude and phase information over three antennas, a 4-layer deep learning model is adopted after obtaining number gesture information. Finally, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is applied for gesture classification. We conduct extensive experiments on commercial Wi-Fi devices with different experimental parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the presented approach can achieve the average accuracy of 94% in current office scenario.","","978-1-5090-4840-3","10.1109/CIS.2016.0022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7820413","Number gesture recognition;Channel State Information;Deep learning;Wi-Fi","Feature extraction;Gesture recognition;Machine learning;Band-pass filters;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication","feature extraction;gesture recognition;image classification;image denoising;learning (artificial intelligence);support vector machines","device-free number gesture recognition;human-computer interface;channel state information;CSI-based technologies;coarse grained feature extraction;macromovement recognition;DeNum;denoised CSI values;multiple sliding windows;discriminative feature extraction;phase information;amplitude information;gesture information;number gesture information;support vector machine;gesture classification;Wi-Fi devices;SVM;4-layer deep learning model","","14","","23","","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop a system for WiFi signal strength-based indoor localization and implement two approaches. The first is improved KNN algorithm-based fingerprint matching method, and the other is the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Bayes Filter approach. We conduct experiments to compare the improved KNN algorithm with the classical KNN algorithm and evaluate the localization performance of the GPR with Bayes Filter approach.

That preliminary step of binary classification is required, for example, in order to send sensor readings to a location-based service. In this paper, we present a binary classifier, based on the well-known machine learning meta-algorithm AdaBoost, which makes use of the received Wi-Fi signals in order to infer the indoor/outdoor condition. The simple, so-called, weak learners, which lie at the heart of every AdaBoost implementation, are based in our case in simple RSSI magnitude comparisons between signal observations. Our solution requires only a coarse-grained training stage to produce two sets of samples (indoor and outdoor) that will be used to calculate the final model composed by several of these extremely simple weak learners. The resulting model is therefore really compact and efficient, which provides scalability to calculate in a fast way whether a device is inside or outside a particular building. In addition, we propose a slight modification of the base AdaBoost meta-algorithm to minimize the negative effect of unpredicted AP failures or changes in the network infrastructure, which will result in a moderate impact on the classification error under those circumstances. In order to verify empirically our proposal, we conducted several tests and we compared our results with those obtained using other well-known classification techniques. Our experiments made use of several devices in two different buildings and show that the resulting performance, a mean error rate around 2.5%, is satisfying.

On the other hand, more heavy and time-varying traffic loads are generated in an MPTCP network, so that an efficient congestion control mechanism that schedules the traffic between multiple subflows and avoids congestion is highly required. In this paper, we propose a decentralized learning approach, DeepCC, to adapt to the volatile environments and realize the efficient congestion control. The Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) is used to learn a policy of congestion control for each subflow according to the real-time network states. To deal with the problem of the fixed state space and slow convergence, we adopt two self-attention mechanisms to receive the states and train the policy, respectively. Due to the asynchronous design of DeepCC, the learning process will not introduce extra delay and overhead on the decision-making process. Experiment results show that DeepCC consistently outperforms the well-known heuristic method and DRL-based MPTCP congestion control method in terms of goodput and jitter. Besides, DeepCC with the attention mechanism reduces convergence time by about 50% and increase goodput by about 80% compared with the commonly used structures of neural networks.","1932-4537","","10.1109/TNSM.2021.3093302","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1807805); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62071067,62001054,61771068); National Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:BX20200067); Ministry of Education and China Mobile Joint Fund(grant numbers:MCM20200202); NSF(grant numbers:EARS-1839818,CNS1717454,CNS-1731424,CNS-1702850); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9467277","Multi-path TCP;congestion control;multi-agent deep reinforcement learning;self-attention","Aerospace electronics;Wireless fidelity;Packet loss;Reinforcement learning;Neural networks;Long Term Evolution;Standards","5G mobile communication;deep learning (artificial intelligence);Internet of Things;multi-agent systems;multipath channels;reinforcement learning;telecommunication congestion control;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","DeepCC;DRL-based MPTCP congestion control method;attention mechanism;neural networks;MultiAgent Deep Reinforcement Learning congestion control;ubiquitous smart devices;network functions;emerging network services;network connections;Multipath TCP protocol;multiple paths;simultaneous data transmission;standard TCP;heavy time-varying traffic loads;MPTCP network;efficient congestion control mechanism;multiple subflows;decentralized learning approach;real-time network states;fixed state space;self-attention mechanisms;learning process","","3","","55","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper focuses on improving indoor localization performance based on Wi-Fi signal processing. Specifically, we propose an annulus local search based localization (ALSL) algorithm, which combines the distance fitting and fingerprint-based techniques. First, ALSL derives the relationship between the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and the Euclidean distance for a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) based on multinomial fitting. Then, an annulus construction scheme is proposed to reduce the online search space for fingerprint-based localization. On this basis, a probability model is derived to estimate the probability of an online point (OP) which is located at certain reference point (RP) based on Bayes theorem. Finally, K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is adopted to compute the final estimated location of an OP. For performance evaluation, we build a prototype of the indoor localization system and implement the ALSL algorithm. We conduct a series of experiments in real-world scenarios, which show that ALSL is able to effectively reduce the computational overhead during the online localization phase with the annulus based local search policy. In addition, our field testing also demonstrates that ALSL can outperform existing competitive solutions in terms of improving the localization accuracy.","","978-1-5386-9380-3","10.1109/SmartWorld.2018.00161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8560139","Indoor localization;Wi Fi signal processing;Fingerprint based technique;Distance fitting","","indoor navigation;indoor radio;probability;radionavigation;RSSI;search problems;wireless LAN","annulus construction scheme;online search space;fingerprint-based localization;final estimated location;indoor localization system;ALSL algorithm;online localization phase;local search policy;localization accuracy;annulus local search based localization algorithm;indoor Wi-Fi environments;location-based services;indoor localization performance;Wi-Fi signal processing;fingerprint-based techniques;received signal strength indicator;Wi-Fi access point;K-nearest-neighbor algorithm","","5","","17","","6 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Being different from the CSI matrix that is processed and discarded in physical layer components, the BFM can be captured using a medium-access-layer frame-capturing technique because this is exchanged among an access point (AP) and stations (STAs) over the air. This indicates that WiFi sensing that leverages the BFM matrix is more practical to implement using the pre-installed APs. However, the ability of BFM-based sensing has been evaluated in a few tasks, and more general insights into its performance should be provided. To fill this gap, we propose a CSI estimation method based on BFM, approximating the estimation function with a machine learning model. In addition, to improve the estimation accuracy, we leverage the inter-subcarrier dependency using the BFMs at multiple subcarriers in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transmissions. Our simulation evaluation reveals that the estimated CSI matches the ground-truth amplitude. Moreover, compared to CSI estimation at each individual subcarrier, the effect of the BFMs at multiple subcarriers on the CSI estimation accuracy is validated.","2331-9860","978-1-6654-3161-3","10.1109/CCNC49033.2022.9700520","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9700520","","Array signal processing;OFDM;Estimation;Machine learning;Physical layer;Frequency estimation;Sensors","","","","","","20","IEEE","10 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data offloading to Wi-Fi networks provides an alternative to relieve the congestion that occurs in such cellular networks. Wi-Fi Access Point to which data is offloaded must be chosen carefully as there is a possibility of Malicious Access Points (MAPs) in the network, which could trick the users to connect with them instead of Legitimate Access Points (LAPs). Thus, the offloaded data may be used for devious purposes by the MAP which results in a severe security breach like military and defense. Therefore, it is necessary to detect and weed out such MAPs. A normalized K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, which is a supervised learning technique, is used to learn from a set of given data pertaining to previous history of Access Points with their characteristic information and decides if the Access Point is malicious or non-malicious. In this paper, we propose a KNN based Evading Malicious Access Point (EMAP) algorithm that identifies MAPs, by using a combination of Round Trip Time (RTT) probes sent and beacon frames received by the user, thus offloading safely to a LAP. The results obtained show that our algorithm has an efficiency of 85% in high as well as low traffic conditions, as compared to lower and variable efficiency of existing proposed methods for identifying MAPs.","","978-1-7281-1322-7","10.1109/CCOMS.2019.8821712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821712","data offloading;legitimate access point;malicious access point;RTT probes;K nearest neighbors","Wireless fidelity;Long Term Evolution;Cellular networks;Probes;Security;Wireless communication;Quality of service","learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","KNN based Evading Malicious Access Point algorithm;supervised learning technique;Wi-Fi Access Point;Wi-Fi networks;data offloading;cellular networks;high data traffic problem;mobile users;mobile devices;Secured LTE-Wi-Fi Offloading;normalized K Nearest Neighbors algorithm;MAP;offloaded data;Legitimate Access Points","","1","","26","","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous researches show the sensing potential of WiFi signals in a device-free passive manner. It is confirmed that human's gait is unique from each other like fingerprint and iris. As a result, researchers start to explore the ability of WiFi in human identification. However, the identification accuracy of existing approaches is not satisfactory in practice. In this paper, we present Wii, a device-free WiFi-based Identity Identification approach utilizing human's gait based on Channel State Information (CSI) of WiFi signals. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and low pass filter are applied to remove the noises in the signals. We then extract entities' gait features from both time and frequency domain. Based on these features, Wii realizes identity identification through a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel. It is implemented using commercial WiFi devices and evaluated in a typical indoor scenario. The results indicate that Wii achieves high identification accuracy with low computational cost and has the potential to work in human behavior analysis systems.","","978-1-5090-5019-2","10.1109/GLOCOM.2017.8254429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8254429","","Feature extraction;Legged locomotion;Wireless fidelity;Wavelet coefficients;Object recognition;Sensors;Continuous wavelet transforms","behavioural sciences computing;Big Data;feature extraction;gait analysis;indoor radio;low-pass filters;principal component analysis;radial basis function networks;support vector machines;wireless LAN","Wii;device-free passive Identity Identification;WiFi signals;human behavior data;passive data collection;human behavior analysis systems;big data;human identification;device-free WiFi;Principle Component Analysis;data collection methods;WiFi devices;PCA;channel state information;CSI;support vector machine;SVM;Radial Basis Function kernel;RBF kernel;human gait;low pass filter","","10","","25","","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The system uses a multistage detector to distinguish signals transmitted by a UAV controller from the background noise and interference signals. First, RF signals from any source are detected using a Markov models-based naïve Bayes decision mechanism. When the receiver operates at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB, and the threshold, which defines the states of the models, is set at a level 3.5 times the standard deviation of the preprocessed noise data, a detection accuracy of 99.8% with a false alarm rate of 2.8% is achieved. Second, signals from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth emitters, if present, are detected based on the bandwidth and modulation features of the detected RF signal. Once the input signal is identified as a UAV controller signal, it is classified using machine learning (ML) techniques. Fifteen statistical features extracted from the energy transients of the UAV controller signals are fed to neighborhood component analysis (NCA), and the three most significant features are selected.

However, the dense environment of multi-RATs challenges the network selection because of the more frequent and complex decision process along with increased complexity. Introducing artificial intelligence to ultra-dense heterogeneous networks can improve the way we address network selection today, and can execute efficient and intelligent network selection. Whereas, there still exist difficulties to be noted. On one hand, the contradiction between real-time communications and time-consuming learning is exacerbated, which can result in slow convergence. On the other hand, the black-box learning mode suffers from oscillation due to the diversity of multi-RATs, which can result in arbitrary convergence. In this paper, we propose a model-driven framework with a joint off-line and on-line way, which is able to achieve fast and optimal network selection through an alliance of machine learning and game theory. Further, we implement a distributed algorithm at the user side based on the proposed framework, which can reduce the number of frequent switching, increase the possibility of gainful switching, and provide the individual service. The simulation results confirm the performance of the algorithm in accelerating convergence rate, boosting user experience, and improving resource utilization.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2898205","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61871454); Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2017JZ021); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2016T90894); Shaanxi Province Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:154066); National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671062,ISN02080001,ISN90106180001); 111 Project(grant numbers:B08038); Shaanxi Province Science and Technology Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2011KJXX-40); US MURI AFOSR MURI(grant numbers:18RT0073); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1717454,CNS-1731424,CNS-1702850,CNS-1646607); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653879","Game theory;heterogeneous networks;machine learning;model-driven;network selection","Switches;Heterogeneous networks;Base stations;Convergence;Reinforcement learning;Rats;Game theory","5G mobile communication;game theory;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;radio access networks","model-driven framework;optimal network selection;machine learning;intelligent user-centric network selection;model-driven reinforcement learning framework;ultra-dense heterogeneous networks;fifth-generation mobile communication system;multiple radio access technologies;dense environment;frequent decision process;complex decision process;artificial intelligence;network selection today;efficient network selection;intelligent network selection;real-time communications;time-consuming learning;black-box learning mode;multiRAT","","15","","53","OAPA","27 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So, an insight into the significance of features may come to aid prior to delving into arduous hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we explore the problem of indoor localization and navigation-feeding to an eternal inquisitiveness of humans about where they are at some unknown venue-showing how inferential ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) can shed off noisy features. We utilize ANOVA for double-thresholding, with the first phase eliminating features with p-values >0.05 and the second round discarding features with F-ratios <; 70, across six indoor locations. This scaled down the feature-count from an initial 127 to an intermediate 125 to a final 50-making no compromise in accuracy or F1-score. We cross-validate the shrunk feature-set using kNN, assuming this will render more reliable metrics than neural networks for the purpose. The approach has shown extendibility to multiple classes and has enabled numerical quantification of the impact of each continuous feature-empowering the decision whether to retain the feature, to the alleviation of the curse of dimensionality.","","978-1-6654-2244-4","10.1109/ICCIT51783.2020.9392702","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9392702","indoor localization;inferential statistics;ANOVA;F-ratio","Location awareness;Computational modeling;Reliability;Noise measurement;Task analysis;Analysis of variance;Tuning","artificial intelligence;indoor navigation;indoor radio;nearest neighbour methods;statistical analysis;wireless LAN","ANOVA;indoor locations;shrunk feature-set;gradual shrinkage;WiFi-based indoor localization;artificial intelligence;arduous hyperparameter tuning;indoor navigation;analysis of variance;kNN;neural networks","","","","13","","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, extracting reliable and concise feature signals remains as a challenging problem, especially in a dynamic and complex environment. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for CSI-based HAR using deep learning network (CH-DLN), with an innovative CSI correlation feature extraction (CCFE) method. The CCFE method pre-processes the signals input to the DLN in two steps. Firstly, it uses a recursive algorithm to reduce non-activity-related information from the signal and hence enhance the activity-dependent signals. Secondly, it computes the correlation over both the time and frequency domain to disclose better signal structure and compress the signal. From such enhanced and compressed signals, we utilize the recurrent neural networking (RNN) to automatically extract deeper features, and then apply the softmax regression algorithm for classifying activities. Through extensive experimental results, our proposed scheme is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in recognition accuracy, with much less training time.","1938-1883","978-1-5386-8088-9","10.1109/ICC.2019.8761445","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8761445","","Training;Generative adversarial networks;Gallium nitride;Deformable models;Fasteners;Generators;Standards","feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);recurrent neural nets;regression analysis;RSSI;wireless LAN","compressed signals;device free WiFi sensing;CSI correlation feature extraction method;CCFE method;recursive algorithm;softmax regression algorithm;recurrent neural networking;activity-dependent signals;nonactivity-related information;deep learning network;CSI-based HAR;channel state information;human activity recognition","","4","","13","","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An adaptive and scalable system is required to offer accurate location-based services (LBSs) for the success of IoT. To enhance the attainment of IoT, we propose a hybrid of principal component analysis (PCA) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithms for mobility predictions in a wireless urban area. During the system development processes, we first collect an LTE signal from three unmanned aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs), the Wi-Fi signal strength from each reachable Wi-Fi access points (APs), and channel information from the Wi-Fi signal media. We then apply PCA to reduce the number of Wi-Fi features and to decrease signal noise. Next, we train the GRU algorithm to develop models that can predict the mobility of IoT device users. Finally, we evaluate the tracking and trajectory models. To evaluate the proposed techniques, we compare the common parameters of the GRU with those of other deep learning types.

Thus, this paper proposes an IoT-based privacy-preserving yoga posture recognition system employing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and a low-resolution infrared sensor-based wireless sensor network (WSN). The WSN has three nodes (x, y, and z-axes) where each integrates 8 × 8 pixels' thermal sensor module and a Wi-Fi module for connecting the deep learning server. We invited 18 volunteers to perform 26 yoga postures for two sessions each lasted for 20 s. First, recorded sessions are saved as .csv files, then preprocessed and converted to grayscale posture images. Totally, 93200 posture images are employed for the validation of the proposed DCNN models. The tenfold cross-validation results revealed that F<sub>1</sub>-scores of the models trained with xyz (all 3-axes) and y (only y-axis) posture images were 0.9989 and 0.9854, respectively.

The development of Bluetooth technology in portable devices makes the problem of insufficient data security between two devices urgent. The existing means of exploiting vulnerabilities allow not only to clone the Bluetooth device's network address, but also to intercept and modify confidential information. To solve this problem, a multiplatform software was developed aimed at preventing attacks such as L2Ping., Redfang., and tools for scanning the airwaves and algorithms for embedding audio tracks into audio devices using the Carwhisperer method. The method is based on predictive processing of a segment of available devices to replace the BT address in case of an attack detection.

This allows for both the ability to shut down all nonessential devices contributing to the electric waste while no one is present, as well as optimise the amount of electricity used in heating, ventilation and air conditioning, depending on the number of people present. In this paper we demonstrate that it is possible to determine the number of people in a room by monitoring the electric power consumption of a WiFi router. We show that the WiFi router's minimum power consuption can be used as features to determine the number of connected devices and link this to the types of data packets used by the network.

Different from existing schemes utilizing only CSI of one or a small subset of subcarriers, Wi-Chase fully utilizes all available subcarriers of the WiFi signal and incorporates variations in both their phases and magnitudes. As each subcarrier carries integral information that will improve the recognition accuracy because of detailed correlated information content in different subcarriers, we can achieve much higher detection accuracy.

This article introduces a view-selective deep learning (VSDL) system for indoor localization using CSI of WiFi. The multiview training with CSI obtained from multiple groups of access points (APs) generates latent features on a supervised variational deep network. This information is then applied to an additional network for dominant view classification to minimize the regression loss of localization. As noninformative latent features from multiple views are rejected, we can achieve a localization accuracy of 1.28 m, which outperforms by 30% the best known accuracy in practical applications in a complex building environment.

The problem is of immense importance in the context of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In many scenarios, there is a high density of people and objects which need to be spatially and temporally tracked. As IoT applications find increasing use not only in industrial applications but also in novel areas such as healthcare in the hospital settings, indoor localisation challenges need redress. The paper addresses a novel technique for indoor localisation for a resolution of 10 cm for Line-of-sight (LoS), and Non-Line-of sight (NLoS) setup. The received signal strength indication (RSSI) based on WiFi signal is thoroughly studied in the past and has offered localisation solutions, yet it is highly sensitive to temporal and spatial variance due to multipath effect. The Channel state information (CSI) signal transmitted from WiFi hardware offers both space and time information, remains relatively stable with multipath propagation and interference, thereby the signal is considered highly suitable for designing localisation techniques with precision. The proposed solution is designed on an open source hardware, and CSI fingerprinting database for 100 locations that are spaced 10 cm apart for line-of-sight (LOS) and Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) configurations are acquired to generate classifier models using different Machine Learning algorithms. Random forest classifier model showed localisation results of 93.15% and 98.01% for LOS and NLOS respectively, for a resolution of 10 cm, which is reported for the first time. The design and technique can be further extended to various applications including patients localisation in dense waiting room of hospitals, home medical care, and other multiple tools localisation in an industrial environment using existing WiFi router infrastructure.","1558-2612","978-1-7281-9505-6","10.1109/WCNC49053.2021.9417483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9417483","","Hospitals;Fingerprint recognition;Tools;Open source hardware;Internet of Things;Received signal strength indicator;Spatial resolution","indoor navigation;indoor radio;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);radionavigation;wireless LAN","decimeter level indoor localisation;single WiFi router;multiple objects;indoor environments;immense importance;Things applications;IoT applications;industrial applications;hospital settings;indoor localisation challenges;line-of-sight;LoS;NonLine-of sight setup;NLoS;signal strength indication;WiFi signal;localisation solutions;temporal variance;spatial variance;multipath effect;Channel state information;WiFi hardware;multipath propagation;interference;localisation techniques;open source hardware;CSI fingerprinting database;LOS;Nonline-of-sight;random forest classifier model;localisation results;NLOS;patients localisation;multiple tools;industrial environment;existing WiFi router infrastructure","","","","22","","5 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) can achieve promising results in highly dynamic and complex environments without the need for an operating model, by learning the optimal strategy after interacting with the environment. However, since the number of possible slice configurations is huge, achieving the optimal strategy requires an exhaustive learning period that might yield an outdated slice configuration. In this paper, we propose a fast-learning DRL model that can dynamically optimize the slice configuration of unplanned Wi-Fi networks without expert knowledge. Enhanced with an off-line learning step, the proposed approach is able to achieve the optimal slice configuration with a fast convergence, which is attractive for dynamic scenarios.","","978-1-7281-1878-9","10.1109/INFCOMW.2019.8845211","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8845211","network slicing;deep reinforcement learning;Wi-Fi networks","Wireless fidelity;Network slicing;Artificial neural networks;Optimization;Convergence;Reinforcement learning;Knowledge engineering","learning (artificial intelligence);radio access networks;wireless LAN","dynamic network slicing;IEEE 802.11 networks;multiple logical networks;unplanned Wi-Fi networks;off-line learning step;deep reinforcement learning;wireless networks;fast-learning DRL model","","9","","20","","23 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we advocate an approach of “learning by observation” that can remove the need for designing explicit and complex performance models. We use machine learning techniques to learn implicit performance models, from a limited number of real-world measurements. These models do not require to know the internal mechanics of interfering Wi-Fi links. Yet, our results show that they improve accuracy by at least 49% compared to measurement-seeded models based on SINR. To demonstrate that learned models can be useful in practice, we build a new algorithm that uses such a model as an oracle to jointly allocate spectrum and transmit power. Our algorithm is utility-optimal, distributed, and it produces efficient allocations that significantly improve performance and fairness.","","978-1-4673-7331-9","10.1109/SAHCN.2015.7338298","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7338298","","Interference;Throughput;Signal to noise ratio;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Resource management;Predictive models;Adaptation models","radio links;resource allocation;wireless LAN","Wi-Fi;wireless network;link adaptation;resource allocation;MAC layers;PHY layers;machine learning techniques","","8","","27","","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

From running the experiments, in a non-laboratory setting, we found that hackable urban environments are interesting platforms for testing IoT technologies. Our findings also suggest that mundane aspects like access to power grids as well as availability and appearance of the build environment can have significant impact on the results of urban IoT experimentation. More generally, this suggest that cities are not hackable by default, and they need to be thoroughly designed and optimized for IoT in order to ensure successful experimentation.","","978-1-7281-2171-0","10.1109/GIOTS.2019.8766406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8766406","IoT;Wi-Fi;Tracking;Cultural Events;Prototyping;Hacking;Experimentation;Smart City","Urban areas;Sensors;Wireless fidelity;Tracking;Computer crime;Mobile handsets;Feature extraction","Internet of Things;power grids;wireless LAN","hackable environments;IoT experiments;Wi-Fi tracking infrastructure;quantitative analysis;collected data;nonlaboratory setting;hackable urban environments;IoT technologies;build environment;urban IoT experimentation;Internet of things experimentation","","1","","30","","22 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Clients' native decision that always prefers 5GHz will consequently cause serious interference in 5GHz and leave 2.4GHz notably idle. Through analyzing a unique dataset in the wild, we quantitatively study the impact of various WiFi factors on the wireless delay. We propose a decision tree approach for intelligent access selection that decides which band to access dynamically according to prior learned schemes. A prototype of the access selection system named LazyAS, which only requires modification at AP side, is realized and deployed in production WiFi network.

The proposed new model extends the traditional deep residual learning model by incorporating two or more channels and let the channels exchange their residual signals after each residual block. Unlike prior deep-learning-based fingerprinting schemes, ResLoc only requires for training one group of weights for all the training locations.

WPS itself suffers from a security flaw; the feature has to be disabled on the devices and user confidence is subverted. In this work we propose to enhance WPS security through the Visual Device Pairing Security (ViDPSec) method to address this problem. ViDPSec is a user-based, lightweight device pairing protocol that establishes secure communication channels between devices, encrypting data with a one time symmetric key that is securely exchanged per session.

Until now, most research has taken a statistical approach and/or purpose-built inference pipeline. Although interesting, these approaches struggle to sustain sensing performances beyond experimental conditions. As such, the full potential of CSI as a general-purpose sensing modality is yet to be realized. We argue that a universal approach with the well-grounded formalization is necessary to characterize the relationship between the wireless channel modulations (spatial and temporal) and human movement. To this end, we present a formalism for quantifying the changing part of the wireless signal modulated by human motion. Grounded in this formalization, we then present a new subspace tracking technique to describe the channel statistics in an interpretable way, which succinctly contains the human modulated part of the channel. We characterize the signal and noise subspaces for the case of uncontrolled human movement and show that these subspaces are dynamic. Our results demonstrate that the proposed channel statistics alone can robustly reproduce the state-of-the-art application-specific feature engineering baseline, however, across multiple usage scenarios. We expect that our universal channel statistics will yield an effective general-purpose featurization of wireless channel measurements and will uncover opportunities for applying CSI for a variety of human sensing applications in a robust way.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2897840","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8636492","Channel sensing;interpretable dimensionality reduction;machine learning;multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Sensors;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Channel models;Wireless fidelity;Modulation","inference mechanisms;statistical analysis;wireless channels;wireless LAN","general-purpose sensing modality;universal approach;well-grounded formalization;wireless channel modulations;wireless signal;human motion;subspace tracking technique;human modulated part;noise subspaces;uncontrolled human movement;state-of-the-art application-specific feature engineering baseline;universal channel statistics;general-purpose featurization;wireless channel measurements;CSI;human sensing applications;subspace approach;Wi-Fi channel state information;plausible modality;wireless devices;statistical approach;approaches struggle;sensing performances;experimental conditions","","2","","24","OAPA","6 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unique WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) patterns of passing vehicles are captured and analyzed to effectively perform vehicle classification, lane detection, and speed estimation. A machine learning technique is adopted to train vehicle classification models and efficiently categorize vehicles. An Earth Mover's Distance (EMD)-based vehicle lane detection algorithm and vehicle speed estimation mechanism are proposed to further utilize WiFi CSI to identify the lane in which a vehicle is located and to estimate the vehicle speed. We implemented WiTraffic with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and performed real-world experiments with over a week of field data collection in both local roads and highways. The results show that the mean classification accuracy, lane detection accuracy for both local road and highway settings are around 96%, and 95%, respectively.

While the challenge that activity recognition is limited to fixed location and complex background, remains unresolved. In this paper, we propose a location-free activity recognition system which leverages fine-grained channel state information (CSI) to recognize same activities regardless of different locations and background. With CSI recorded in the Network Interface Card (NIC), Angle Difference of Arrival (ADoA) is reckoned to eliminate the location and background information, which is only consistent with the activity tendency. Then the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method is utilized to reduce the dimension and followed by curve smoothing to make the signal more smoother. Furthermore, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network is selected as ideal training machine to deal with issues that are highly correlated with time series.

One effective approach for increasing the positioning accuracy is the adoption of advanced mathematics-based algorithms in IPS design. The sparse-formulation ability of the positioning problem encourages toward the utilizing of the promising Compressive Sensing (CS) theory in IPS frameworks. In the other hand, the WLAN-Fingerprinting is yet the widely incorporated technique for RF-based IPSs since it doesn't require an additional hardware installation as well as its high noise-immunity. The proper manipulation of the collected Wi-Fi signals adds more accuracy to IPSs. In this paper, we are proposing a Multiple-Fingerprints (MFPs) technique for CS, Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) RSSI-Fingerprinting based IPSs. In this technique, each Reference Point (RP) in the Area of Interest (AOI) is represented by a set of RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) vectors as multiple fingerprints. These sets are generated from the RSSI time-samples that were collected during the offline-phase by means of two different approaches; they are the random combinations and the FPs partitioning. The performance of CS, PNN, and k-NN based IPSs are evaluated by using the proposed technique. Results show that the positioning performance of IPSs with MFPs technique outperforms that for the typical single FP systems.","","978-1-5386-4649-6","10.1109/CCWC.2018.8301665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8301665","Indoor Positioning;Fingerprinting;Compressive Sensing;Access Point Selection;Multiple Fingerprints","IP networks;Fingerprint recognition;Compressed sensing;Heuristic algorithms;Wireless fidelity;Smart phones","compressed sensing;indoor radio;neural nets;probability;RSSI;wireless LAN","accuracy performance;Indoor Positioning Systems;positioning accuracy;IPS design;sparse-formulation ability;positioning problem;IPS frameworks;WLAN-Fingerprinting;RF-based IPSs;high noise-immunity;collected Wi-Fi signals;Probabilistic Neural Network;PNN;RSSI time-samples;k-NN based IPSs;positioning performance;MFPs technique;compressive sensing theory;CS theory;multiple-fingerprint technique;single FP systems;advanced mathematics-based algorithms;k-nearest neighbor RSSI-fingerprinting based IPSs;reference point;area of interest;AOI;received signal strength indicator vector","","","","20","","26 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, various sensors have been used for localization, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS, LiDAR and cameras. In particular, a class of vision-based localization techniques using Structure from Motion (SfM) has been shown to produce very accurate position estimates in the real-world with moderate assumptions about the motion of the camera and the amount of visual texture in the environment. However, when these assumptions are violated, SfM techniques can fail catastrophically (i.e., cannot generate any estimate). Recently, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has been applied to images to robustly regress 6-DOF camera poses at the cost of lower accuracy than SfM. In this work, we propose improving image-based localization accuracy of deep CNN by combining Bluetooth radio-wave signal readings. In our experiments, we show that our proposed dual-stream CNN can robustly regress 6-DOF poses from images and radiowave signals better than one sensing modality alone. More importantly, we show that when both modes are used, the localization accuracy of the proposed deep CNN is comparable to that of SfM and significantly more robust than SfM.","","978-1-5386-4886-5","10.1109/WACV.2018.00071","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8354175","","Cameras;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization;Sensors;Robustness;Wireless fidelity;Solid modeling","Bluetooth;cameras;computer vision;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;Global Positioning System;image motion analysis;image sensors;navigation;pose estimation;regression analysis;wireless LAN","deep radio-visual localization;automated navigation applications;redundant sensing technologies;Wi-Fi;cameras;vision-based localization techniques;visual texture;SfM techniques;deep convolutional neural network;localization accuracy;deep CNN;Bluetooth radio-wave signal readings;dual-stream CNN;sensing modality;position estimates;GPS;LiDAR;structure-from-motion;6-DOF camera poses","","3","","42","","7 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various emerging service applications are promising to increase the quality of experience (QoE) of users. On-board computation tasks generated by these applications have been heavily overloading resource-constrained vehicles, making it increasingly to offload on-board tasks to other edge intelligence (EI)-assisted servers. However, excessive task offloading can lead to severe competition for communication and computation resources among vehicles, thereby increasing the processing latency, energy consumption, and system cost. To address the above problem, we investigate the transmission-awareness and computing-sense uplink resource management problem and formulate it as a time-varying Markov decision process. Considering the total delay, energy consumption, and cost, quantum-inspired reinforcement learning (QRL) is proposed to develop an intelligence-oriented edge offloading strategy. Specifically, the vehicle can flexibly choose the network access mode and offloading strategy through two different radio interfaces to offload tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers through WiFi and cloud servers through 5G. The objective of this joint optimization is to maintain a self-adaptive balance between these two aspects.

The research results show that Wi-Fi and base station equipment are the main factors causing indoor electromagnetic exposure, and the radiation intensity of the former is much higher than the latter when the equipment is working. Also, the change of EMR over time conforms to the users’ daily work and rest cycle and contains a significant low-frequency component with a 24-h cycle and complex high-frequency components. Besides, the intensive use of electronic products by users has been proven to have a great impact on the frequency characteristics of the electric field, and the complexity of the time–frequency characteristics of EMR time series has increased, resulting in poor prediction results of the models such as the seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) model and the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.

The achievable peak gain is 16 dB with a -3 dB bandwidth between 100 MHz and 5 GHz, while the input matching provides a Su <; -9 dB between 100 MHz and 10 GHz. The noise figure is kept below 5 dB until the frequency of 9.5 GHz. The linearity of the amplifier gives an input P\<sub>dB</sub> and IIP3 of -17 dBm and -6 dBm respectively. The power consumption is only 6.3 mW. The area of the chip occupies only 0.1 mm<sup>2</sup> with pads included.","","978-2-87487-043-9","10.1109/EuMC.2016.7824521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7824521","low noise amplifier;linearity;low power;input matching;bandwidth;noise figure (NF);feedback;feedforward","Impedance matching;Gain;Noise measurement;Wideband;Feedforward neural networks;Impedance;Linearity","CMOS integrated circuits;feedforward amplifiers;low noise amplifiers;microwave amplifiers;wideband amplifiers","feedforward path;noise figure;CMOS technology;current reuse shunt-shunt feedback architecture;WCDMA;GSM;Bluetooth;WiFi;multistandard wireless applications;feedforward technique;input matching;inductorless wideband LNA;size 65 nm;voltage 1.2 V;power 6.3 mW","","2","","10","","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The WiFi fingerprinting positioning using received signal strength (RSS) measurements suffers from the RSS variation problem. Due to this problem, reference points that are irrelevant to the user's position are selected, and the positioning accuracy decreases. To overcome the RSS variation problem, we propose an IMU-assisted nearest neighbor selection algorithm that filters out irrelevant reference points based on the position prediction with IMU measurements. The proposed algorithm was evaluated and compared with the conventional ii-nearest neighbors (KNN) selection and the IMU-based dead-reckoning positioning in a real indoor environment. The experimental results showed that the average positioning error of the proposed algorithm was 2.41 m, whereas those of the KNN-based fingerprinting algorithm and the IMU-based dead-reckoning positioning were 3.57 m and 15.27 m.","","978-1-4673-8054-6","10.1109/IPIN.2014.7275556","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7275556","","Prediction algorithms;Position measurement;Signal processing algorithms;Accuracy;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Current measurement;Wireless communication","fingerprint identification;Global Positioning System;RSSI;wireless LAN","IMU-assisted nearest neighbor selection algorithm;real-time Wi-Fi fingerprinting positioning;inertial measurement unit;received signal strength measurement;RSS variation problem;average positioning error","","6","","17","","28 Sep 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the general failure of GPS indoors, non-GNSS navigation technologies are essential for such areas. Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) have widely been employed for indoor localisation based on the Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based location fingerprinting technique. The fingerprinting technique stores the location-dependent characteristics of a signal collected at known locations ahead of the system's use for localisation in a database. When positioning, the user's device records its own vector(s) of signal strength and matches it against the pre-recorded database of vectors by applying pattern matching algorithms. Location is then calculated based on the best matches between the new and stored vectors. We examined the relationship between the measured Manhattan Distance (MD), Euclidean Distance (ED), and other vector distances over the geometric distance between Reference Points (RPs) in a fingerprint database. The correlation between geometric and vector distance was poor. However, because “nearest neighbor” algorithms are used, only short vector distances are important. Furthermore, the measured RSSs varied much more as a function of distance (due to fast fading) than it did as a function of time at a single test point. Hence, the difference between variances measured at two test points was not a good indicator of the measured difference in signal strength. This led to the current investigation of very short geometric distances. In this paper, a new algorithm is applied to examine data from locations at very short ranges from each other and to investigate the relationship between vector distance and the geometric distance in closer areas in order to observe the nature of the relationship between short-range fingerprints. The experimental test bed was carried out in a large furnished office. Two west-east and south-north lines in a cross shape with 4m length are considered. We find that even at short distances, variation due to fading dominates and using other vector distances instead of MD or ED can help decrease the effect of such variation in positioning.","","978-1-4673-1954-6","10.1109/IPIN.2012.6418852","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418852","indoor positioning;fingerprinting;error modeling","Fingerprint recognition;Position measurement;Artificial neural networks","Global Positioning System;indoor communication;vectors;wireless LAN","WiFi fingerprinting signal strength error modeling;location-based service;LBS;social networking service;SNS;indoor positioning;GPS indoor;nonGNSS navigation technology;wireless local area network;WLAN;received signal strength;location fingerprinting technique;location-dependent characteristic;pattern matching;Manhattan distance;Euclidean distance;vector distance;geometric distance;nearest neighbor algorithm;short-range fingerprints","","15","","14","","24 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EyeFi integrates a WiFi chipset to an overhead camera and fuses motion trajectories obtained from both vision and RF modalities to identify individuals. In order to do that, EyeFi uses a student-teacher model to train a neural network to estimate the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of WiFi packets from the CSI values. Based on extensive evaluation using real-world data, we observe that EyeFi improves WiFi CSI based AoA estimation accuracy by more than 30% and offers 3,800 times computational speed over the state-of-the-art solution.

Although wireless technologies have significantly advanced in the past decades, most wireless networks are still vulnerable to radio jamming attacks due to the openness nature of wireless channels, and the progress in the design of jamming-resistant wireless networking systems remains limited. This stagnation can be attributed to the lack of practical physical-layer wireless technologies that can efficiently decode data packets in the presence of jamming attacks. This article surveys existing jamming attacks and anti-jamming strategies in wireless local area networks (WLANs), cellular networks, cognitive radio networks (CRNs), ZigBee networks, Bluetooth networks, vehicular networks, LoRa networks, RFID networks, GPS system, millimeter-wave (mmWave) and learning-assisted wireless systems, with the objective of offering a comprehensive knowledge landscape of existing jamming and anti-jamming strategies and therefore stimulating more research efforts to secure wireless networks against jamming attacks. Different from prior survey papers, this article conducts a comprehensive, in-depth review on jamming and anti-jamming strategies, casting insights on the design of jamming-resilient wireless networking systems.

However, knowledge factors are usually vulnerable to the spoofing attack. Recently, the inheritance factor, such as fingerprints, emerges as an efficient alternative resilient to malicious users, but it normally requires special equipment. To this end, in this article, we propose WiPass, a device-free authentication system only leveraging the pervasive Wi-Fi infrastructure to explore keystroke dynamics (manner and rhythm of keystrokes) captured by the channel state information to recognize legitimate users while rejecting spoofers. However, it remains an open challenge to characterize the behavioral features hidden in the human subtle motions, such as keystrokes. Therefore, we build a signal enhancement model using Ricean distribution to amplify user keystroke dynamics and a hybrid learning model for user authentication, which consists of two parts, i.e., convolutional neural network based feature extraction and support vector machine based classification. The former relies on visualizing the channel responses into time-series images to learn the behavioral features of keystrokes in energy and spectrum domains, whereas the latter exploits such behavioral features for user authentication. We prototype WiPass on the low-cost off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices and verify its performance. Empirical results show that WiPass achieves on average 92.1% authentication accuracy, 5.9% false accept rate, and 6.3% false reject rate in three real environments.","1941-0050","","10.1109/TII.2021.3108850","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772169); Basic Business Expenses of Central Public Welfare Scientific Research Institutes; Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences(grant numbers:2020-JKCS-002); Key Research and Development Plan of Anhui Province(grant numbers:202004b11020018); JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP20F20080); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9527098","Behavioral features;channel state information (CSI);convolutional neural network (CNN);Ricean distribution;user authentication","Authentication;Wireless fidelity;Support vector machines;Password;Fading channels;Informatics;Feature extraction","","","","","","38","IEEE","1 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we introduce a technique to schedule the content for prefetching based on mobile usage patterns. This technique utilizes both a content profile as well as a bandwidth profile to schedule content for prefetching. Users can then use the cached version of the content in order to achieve a better user experience and reduce the peak-to-average ratio in mobile networks, especially during peak hours of the day.

Its localization process consists of two stages, coarse localization and fine localization. The coarse localization of WiFi fingerprint is convenient and fast, but not accurate enough. However, the fine localization of AMCL is computationally complex, but relatively accurate. Therefore, the integration of WiFi fingerprint and AMCL for localization can be more accurate and efficient. In the coarse localization, the fingerprint method based on KNN is utilized to locate the position of robot and send the estimated position and estimated error to the ROS robot. Then, in the fine localization, the localization result estimated by WiFi fingerprint is regarded as the initial state of AMCL which can locate the exact position of robot based on grid map. In addition, in order to prevent the error caused by the slip of drive wheel and the cumulative error of the odometer, this paper fuses the information of odometer and inertial measurement unit (IMU) by EKF to improve the proposed distribution. The experimental results show that the proposed method can shorten the iterative time and improve the global localization accuracy of robot.","2473-3547","978-1-5386-3675-6","10.1109/ISCID.2017.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8275781","indoor localization;AMCL;WiFi fingerprint;proposed distribution","Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity;Robot kinematics;Buildings;Mobile robots;Monte Carlo methods","adaptive control;distance measurement;Kalman filters;mobile robots;Monte Carlo methods;nonlinear filters;path planning;position control;wireless LAN","indoor localization method;mobile robot;robot position;position estimation;ROS robot;grid map;odometer;inertial measurement unit;EKF;fingerprint method;fine localization;coarse localization;localization process;adaptive Monte Carlo localization;AMCL;WiFi fingerprint","","7","","12","","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To enhance the inference throughput, recent studies proposed collaborative intelligence (CI) that splits DNN computation into edge and cloud platforms, mostly for simple tasks such as image classification. However, for general DNN-based object detectors with a branching architecture, CI is highly restricted because of a significant feature transmission overhead. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a splittable object detector that enables edge-cloud collaborative real-time video inference. The proposed architecture includes a feature reconstruction network that can generate multiple features required for detection using a small-sized feature from the edge-side extractor. Asymmetric scaling on the feature extractor and reconstructor further reduces the transmitted feature size and edge inference latency, while maintaining detection accuracy. The performance evaluation using Yolov5 shows that the proposed model achieves 28 fps (2.45X and 1.56X higher than edge-only and cloud-only inference, respectively), on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 platform in WiFi environment.","","978-1-6654-3396-9","10.1109/AVSS52988.2021.9663806","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9663806","","Performance evaluation;Image edge detection;Collaboration;Detectors;Streaming media;Feature extraction;Throughput","cloud computing;CMOS logic circuits;CMOS memory circuits;computer vision;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);logic design;neural nets;object detection;speech recognition;trigger circuits","splittable DNN-based object detector;edge-cloud collaborative real-time video inference;deep neural networks;computer vision tasks;edge devices;real-time inference;complex DNN models;inference throughput;DNN computation;general DNN-based object detectors;significant feature transmission;splittable object detector;feature reconstruction network;edge-side extractor;cloud-only inference","","","","25","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, it represents a more efficient and scalable approach to infer users' sensitive information without checking the content of Wi-Fi traffic. Secondly, meta-data based demographics inference can work on both unencrypted and encrypted traffic (e.g., HTTPS traffic). In this study, we present a novel approach to infer user demographic information by exploiting the meta-data of Wi-Fi traffic. We develop a proof-of-concept prototype, Demographic Information Predictor (DIP) system, and evaluate its performance on a real-world dataset, which includes the Wi-Fi access of 28,158 users in 5 months. DIP extracts four kinds of features from real-world Wi-Fi traffic and proposes a novel machine learning based inference technique to predict user demographics. Our analytical results show that, for unencrypted traffic, DIP can predict gender and education level of users with an accuracy of 78% and 74% respectively. It is surprising to show that, even for HTTPS traffic, user demographics can still be predicted at a precision of 67% and 72% respectively, which well demonstrates the practicality of the proposed privacy inference scheme.","","978-1-4673-9953-1","10.1109/INFOCOM.2016.7524528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7524528","","IEEE 802.11 Standard;Privacy;Electronics packaging;Cryptography;Protocols;Feature extraction","computer network security;cryptography;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","demographics inference;Wi-Fi network traffic analysis;Wi-Fi traffic;privacy inference;user privacy;sensitive information;encrypted traffic;unencrypted traffic;HTTPS traffic;proof-of-concept prototype;demographic information predictor;DIP system","","24","","23","","28 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Drawing from the ability of machine learning (ML) to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems, some ML-aided techniques have been developed to assist signal detection in AmBC. Hence, this article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the subject by describing the operation of the AmBC network, highlighting the major challenges to signal detection in AmBC, discussing and com-paring the performance of some existing ML-assisted solutions to AmBC signal detection, and highlighting some future research that could be carried out on the subject.","1558-156X","","10.1109/MNET.001.2100247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9687463","","Wireless communication;Performance evaluation;Wireless sensor networks;TV;Receivers;Sensors;Communication networks","","","","1","","15","","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

They, however, are far away from completed due to for example the increase of new Internet applications and traffic encryption. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework to classify the Internet traffic, combining a classifier based on the well-known port numbers and packet payload signatures, and a novel heuristic-based co-clustering algorithm for classifying the leftover unknown Internet traffic. Taking advantage of a fast unsupervised co-clustering algorithm with simple flow-based features, our traffic classifier can perform a real-time computing online for application discovery on the Internet. Experimental evaluations with over 200,000 network flows collected over two consecutive days on a large-scale WiFi ISP show that the proposed approach successfully classifies a large portion of the Internet traffic missed by the signature based classifier while also reducing the false alarm rate.","","978-1-4799-2653-4","10.1109/WAINA.2014.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6844612","Internet traffic classification;machine learning","IP networks;Internet;Communities;Classification algorithms;Ports (Computers);Payloads;Heuristic algorithms","cryptography;digital signatures;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern clustering;telecommunication security;telecommunication traffic","heuristic-based coclustering algorithm;Internet traffic classification;network traffic classification;large-scale communication networks;port numbers;packet payload signatures;traffic classification tools;Internet applications;traffic encryption;flow-based features;traffic classifier;real-time computing online;application discovery;network flows;large-scale WiFi ISP;false alarm rate;machine learning","","10","","46","","26 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, IoT is able to communicate data between machine to machine and the data that is previously available to private server now easily available to the internet so that it can be accessed efficiently. This paper show the increase in the usage of IoT in monitoring like applications. Smart farming is the technique which intend to provide all the necessary resources for the specified amount of time. These resources required are light intensity, ambient temperature required, relative humidity, soil moisture content, pH reading of the soil. The central idea is to sense all these parameters one by one and take the final decision accordingly. A sensor node should be developed for sensing all the required resources parameters and subsequently send the data to the cloud for further processing. After getting all the required resources values our final aim is to predict the crop production using various data mining techniques. As the human lives are primarily depended on the food resources, the agricultural process need to be efficient and this efficiency can be enhanced if there is an accurate amount of resources. By getting the accurate amount of resources, Data mining techniques such as Random forest, KNN, SVM are used to analyze the crop production in advance such that farmer always have an upper hand on it and by comparing with the previous trend he will be able to detect which kind of parameter is accurate and which is not.

In this paper, we propose to use an intermediate channel measurement - spatial beam signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) that are inherently available during the beam training phase as defined in the IEEE 802.11ad standard - to construct the feature space for location-and-orientation-dependent fingerprinting database. We build a 60GHz experimental platform consisting of three access points and one client using commercial-off-the-shelf routers and collect realworld beam SNR measurements in an office environment during regular office hours. Both position/orientation classification and coordinate estimation are considered using classic machine learning approaches. Comprehensive performance evaluation using real-world beam SNRs demonstrates that the classification accuracy is 99.8% if the location is only interested, while the accuracy is 98.6% for simultaneous position-and-orientations classification. Direct coordinate estimation gives an average root-mean-square error of 17.52 cm and 95% of all coordinate estimates are less than 26.90 cm away from corresponding true locations. This concept directly applies to other mmWave band (e.g., 5G) devices where beam training is also required.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9014103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9014103","","Signal to noise ratio;Training;Antenna measurements;Wireless fidelity;Estimation;OFDM;Phased arrays","estimation theory;learning (artificial intelligence);mean square error methods;millimetre wave communication;radio direction-finding;signal classification;wireless channels;wireless LAN","location-and-orientation-dependent fingerprinting database;intermediate channel measurement;RSSI measurements;received signal strength indicator measurements;CSI;mmWave WiFi band;spatial beam SNR measurements;performance evaluation;machine learning approaches;office environment;routers;IEEE 802.11ad standard;beam training phase;beam signal-to-noise ratios;MAC layer;fine-grained channel state information;fingerprint-based indoor localization;frequency 60.0 GHz","","4","","27","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As most of these LBS are acquired from indoor locations, accurate indoor positioning system is important. To date, the most widely used WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network) fingerprint-based indoor positioning algorithm is based on state-of-the-art k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) technique due to its simplicity and robustness. This paper proposes a novel AP weighting technique combined with an improved matching technique for kNN. The strategy is two-fold; first, the signal distance calculation within the algorithm is weighted using signal information of local AP in each fingerprint a nd second, the matching process of the classical kNN algorithm is improved to obtain more accurate position estimates. The results show that the mean error of the proposed algorithm performs up to 14% better than state-of-the-art weighted kNN algorithm and at the same time also outperformed other enhanced version of the kNN algorithm. From the real experiment, we obtained the best k value of 8 which gives the mean positioning error of 2.70 m over an indoor area of 440 square meters.","","978-8-8872-3745-0","10.23919/AEIT.2019.8893365","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8893365","Indoor Positioning;WLAN;Wi-Fi;Nearest Neighbor;kNN;Pattern Matching","Weight measurement;Standards;Databases;Software algorithms;Physics;Wireless fidelity","indoor radio;location based services;nearest neighbour methods;radionavigation;wireless LAN","classical kNN algorithm;mean positioning error;weighted local access point;fine matching k-nearest neighbor algorithm;Location-based Service;LBS;smart city application;indoor locations;accurate indoor positioning system;Wireless Local Area Network;ndoor positioning algorithm;k-Nearest Neighbour;novel AP weighting technique;improved matching technique;signal distance calculation;signal information;local AP;matching process;WLAN fingerprint-based indoor positioning algorithm;weighted kNN algorithm","","4","","17","","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among existing recognition algorithms, most of them utilize domain adversarial neural networks, such as DANN [6], to achieve recognition between diverse domains. However, these methods try to fully align the feature distributions while each domain has specific characteristics, which leads to different decision boundaries and substantially degrades the recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained method called Wi-Adaptor to tackle these problems. Wi-Adaptor utilizes two classifiers to match distributions of source and target samples by considering the decision boundaries. In order to detect target samples that are far from the support of the source, we train the classifiers to maximize the discrepancy between their outputs and train the feature generator to generate target features that minimize the discrepancy. Our experiments show that Wi-Adaptor outperforms other traditional domain adversarial adaptation models and show robustness as we limit the source samples. Especially in the case of reducing the source samples to a half, Wi-Adaptor achieves more than 30% accuracy gain in different domain adaptation experiments.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685725","NSFC(grant numbers:61932017,61971390); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685725","","Adaptation models;Conferences;Neural networks;Activity recognition;Feature extraction;Robustness;Generators","","","","","","19","","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, reducing the burden of offline site survey becomes an important issue for fingerprint-based indoor localization. In this paper, using a low-tubal-rank tensor to model Wi-Fi fingerprints of all reference points (RPs), we propose an adaptive sampling scheme via approximate volume sampling to improve reconstruction accuracy of radio map with reduced expenditure. We propose a rank-increasing strategy to effectively estimate the rank of the underlying fingerprint tensor to alleviate the computation burden for tensor completion. We provide a theoretical foundation to analyze the proposed scheme and derive the performance bounds in terms of sample complexity and reconstruction error. We prove that the proposed scheme can achieve a relative error guarantee. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through extensive simulations using both synthetic and real datasets.

This paper shows that the accuracy of counting human occupancy levels using CSI is dependent on the underlying traffic type, and that there is a degradation in performance when the classifier encounters an unseen traffic type. We experimentally demonstrate that using ambient traffic from end user devices has better accuracy outcomes than leveraging WiFi Access Points (AP). This paper further shows that multiple spatially diverse streams of WiFi CSI can be used for sensing to an accuracy of 99%, and we demonstrate that these multiple streams would reduce the accuracy of CSI sensing systems in literature which are trained for one transmission source.

In this paper we introduce SensTrack, a location tracking service which leverages sensor hints on the smartphone to reduce the usage of GPS. SensTrack selectively executes a GPS sampling by utilizing the information from accelerometer and orientation sensor, and switches to alternate location sensing method based on WiFi when users go indoors. A machine learning technique, Gaussian Process Regression, is then employed to reconstruct the track from recorded location samples.

One of the major research focuses of 6G is to enable massive Internet of Things (mIoT) applications. Like Wi-Fi 6 (IEEE 802.11ax), forthcoming wireless communication networks are likely to meet massively deployed devices and extremely new smart applications such as smart cities for mIoT. However, channel scarcity is still present due to a massive number of connected devices accessing the common spectrum resources. With this expectation, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and beyond for mIoT are anticipated to have inherent machine intelligence capabilities to access the optimum channel resources for their performance optimization. Unfortunately, current wireless communication network standards do not support the ensuing needs of machine learning (ML)-aware frameworks in terms of resource allocation optimization.

However, the accuracy requirement needs enough data sampled at many reference points, which consumes significant manpower and time. In this paper, we convert the acquired Channel State Information (CSI) data to feature maps using complex wavelet transform and then extend the fingerprint database by the proposed Wavelet Transform-Feature Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network model. With this model, the convergence process in training phase can be accelerated and the diversity of generated feature maps can be increased significantly. Based on the extended fingerprint database, the accuracy of indoor localization system can be improved with reduced human effort.","","978-1-5386-4920-6","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2018.8644149","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644149","Wi-Fi indoor localization;Fingerprint database;Channel state information;Generative adversarial network;Feature map","Databases;Wavelet transforms;Training;Gallium nitride;Economic indicators;Wireless fidelity","convolutional neural nets;indoor radio;wavelet transforms;wireless LAN","indoor localization system;diversity promoted fingerprint construction;Wi-Fi positioning;mainstream indoor localization method;feature maps;fingerprint database;channel state information;complex wavelet transform;wavelet transform DC-GAN;deep convolutional generative adversarial network","","4","","17","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This fact makes topological representation of maps very important in navigation and localization applications. When infrastructure-based systems (e.g., GPS, Wi-Fi) are available, the problem is referred to as map-matching where the goal is to improve localization accuracy. On the other hand, localization becomes a problem in the lack of initialization for infrastructure-free systems (e.g., dead reckoning via odometry). For example, a pedestrian inertial navigation system (INS) can be used to generate drift-prone trajectories that would perfectly turn into graphs (consisting of nodes and edges) after heuristic corrections such as zero-velocity update (ZUPT), heuristic drift reduction (HDR) and motion direction aid by Earth's magnetic field. Most of the approaches use probabilistic generative methods to solve sub-graph traversal problem. This research adopts a neural network structure that is originally designed for language translation purposes and modifies it to achieve pedestrian localization on topological maps. Different feature combinations (angle vs. edge length) and number of traversed nodes are tested in the experiments. A minimum accuracy of 95% is achieved with all feature configurations while traversing only six nodes on the map.","2168-9229","978-1-7281-1634-1","10.1109/SENSORS43011.2019.8956924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8956924","location based services;open street maps;link/node model;graph traversal;routing graphs;Neural Ma-chine Translation Network;Deep Learning","","distance measurement;Global Positioning System;graph theory;inertial navigation;language translation;mobile robots;path planning;pedestrians","topological maps;neural machine translation network;vehicles;infrastructure-based systems;Wi-Fi;map-matching;localization accuracy;infrastructure-free systems;pedestrian inertial navigation system;drift-prone trajectories;heuristic corrections;motion direction aid;probabilistic generative methods;sub-graph traversal problem;neural network structure;language translation purposes;pedestrian localization;feature combinations","","3","","34","","14 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many universities leverage hybrid learning models, in which students join a real-time video session via Wi-Fi from several classrooms to ensure safety and social distancing. This is creating a significant strain on the wireless access network, which is required to deliver an unusually high level of traffic. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) solutions have emerged as a way to make networks easier to control and to manage. However, their black box nature and in general their fire and forget approach has generated considerable skepticism over the entire value chain, from vendors to network administrators. This situation has led to a new interest in interpretable AI solutions, which aim at making the decisions taken by AI/ML models intelligible to a domain expert. In this article, we review the concept of interpretable AI and analyze the challenges, requirements, and benefits it can bring to delay-sensitive content delivery in 802.11 Wi-Fi networks. Furthermore, we apply these requirements to a use case in which we focus on advanced Quality of Service (QoS) provision, and we propose an interpretable and low-complexity ML model that addresses those requirements.

Governments has enforced patrols, security forces, and security equipments such as door frame detectors, screens and hand-held detectors in public places like railway stations and airports. The main purpose of these security equipments is to detect potentially dangerous metal objects. And the way to detect metal is mainly based on electromagnetic induction and X-rays. On the one hand, detectors based on electromagnetic induction needs to be placed close to the examined objects and on the other hand, detectors based on X-rays are usually large, expensive, complex, harmful and the detecting distance is limited on many occasions. For the above reasons, current metal detection equipments cannot be deployed on a large scale with a low cost scheme. But with the popular use of Wi-Fi in public areas, low-cost and large-scale deployment is possible if we could use Wi-Fi to detect metal. Since the dielectric constant and the reflection coefficient of metal are different from those of nonmetal objects, the effect of Wi-Fi signal reflection caused by metal objects is different from nonmetal items as well. Thus we attempt to use this observation to enable metal detection. But using Wi-Fi to detect metal will encounter some challenges. Factors such as the interference caused by multi-path effect and other signal sources, shapes, materials and surface smoothness of the target, as well as the angle of reflection will cause great impact on a detecting result. However, we implement a system by using a series of methods to eliminate most of the interferences and use machine learning algorithm to identify metal. We implement this system in commercial products. We conduct several experiments and their average accuracy and false alarm are respectively more than 90% and less than 10% in 1 meter detecting distance.","1938-1883","978-1-4799-6664-6","10.1109/ICC.2016.7511472","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7511472","Metal Detection;Channel State Information;Wi-Fi","Metals;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Detectors;OFDM;Interference;Radar;Receivers","learning (artificial intelligence);metal detectors;multipath channels;object detection;radiofrequency interference;weapons;wireless LAN","hand-held detectors;patrols enforcement;machine learning;surface smoothness;signal sources;multipath effect interference;reflection coefficient;dielectric constant;large-scale deployment;low-cost deployment;Wi-Fi;dangerous metal objects;security equipments;Wi-metal;wireless networks;metal detection equipments","","9","","15","","14 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With burgeoning demand for wireless connectivity, the stress put on an already scarce resource (namely spectrum) is reaching a breaking point. Hence, it has become pivotal to find ways for the efficient and equitable utilization of spectrum. Multiband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MBOFDM) is a technique that is primarily under consideration to tackle the problem of effective utilization of spectrum. One of the most popular systems in usage, the Ultra Wideband (UWB) systems, has a serious flaw. It poses a threat to other wireless connectors such as Wi-Fi, WiMax etc. As such interferences go against the scheme of equitable use; complicated interference cancellation schemes become necessary for the isolation of such networks. Traditionally, error control codes were used to make such troublesome or noisy channels available for reliable communication. But the other method that has recognizably more potential for solving the problem of spectrum congestion is Cognitive Radio. This paper mainly focuses on the MB-OFDM systems with the following enhancements: 1) Concatenation of convolutional code with Reed Solomon code and to analyze the performance of MBOFDM systems under various modulation schemes 2) Active interference cancellation between primary and secondary users using AIC tones and 3) Spectrum sensing using energy detection method and to train a classifier to do the same using neural network in order to solve the problem of spectrum.","","978-1-4577-1583-9","10.1109/ICCCI.2012.6158853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6158853","UWB;MB-OFDM;Convolutional code;RS code;concatenated code;PSK;QAM;AIC;ANN","Cognitive radio;Sensors;Artificial neural networks;OFDM;Interference cancellation","3G mobile communication;cognitive radio;error correction codes;interference suppression;OFDM modulation","anti-interference;anticorroupt 3G spectrum;multicarrier approach;wireless connectivity;ultrawideband systems;UWB systems;interference cancellation;error control codes;cognitive radio;MB-OFDM systems;zenith;myriad utilizations;multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","","3","","13","","1 Mar 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We observe that the commonly used simple replication approach for mitigating frequent handovers comes at the cost of many duplicate packet transmissions and so wasted network capacity. Instead we take the approach of predicting when a handover is about to occur and only replicating packets shortly before it happens, significantly reducing the amount of redundancy needed and freeing up network resources. We propose a novel neural network predictor, based only on features extracted from the WiFi client log, that predicts when a handover will occur. We train and evaluate our predictor on a large data set collected in a production environment, and show it predicts handover with high accuracy. We use this predictor as a basis for an adaptive replication scheme and compare it against simple replication and no replication. Results show that when application throughput is low compared to link capacity, our scheme achieves 91% of the loss reduction provided by simple replication on average while using only 13% of the redundancy and experiencing 20% less latency. When application throughput is high compared to link capacity, simple replication causes more losses compared to no replication, while our scheme maintains a lower loss rate compared to no replication.","2637-9430","978-1-6654-1278-0","10.1109/ICCCN52240.2021.9522347","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9522347","","Adaptation models;Redundancy;Packet loss;Handover;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Throughput","feature extraction;mobile radio;mobility management (mobile radio);quality of service;telecommunication traffic;wireless LAN","smart replication;seamless time communication;efficient real time communication;underground railway train;mission-critical traffic;strict QoS requirements;low packet loss;underground trains;multiple WiFi backhauls;simple replication;mitigating frequent handovers;duplicate packet transmissions;network capacity;handover;network resources;novel neural network predictor;WiFi client log;adaptive replication scheme","","","","18","","31 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper is the first to reveal energy-delay tradeoffs in a holistic view considering multiple wireless interfaces, DVFS and multitasking in smartphone. We perform real measurements on WiFi/3G coverage and throughput, power consumption of CPU and WiFi/3G interfaces, and CPU workloads. Trace-driven simulations based on the measurements demonstrate that SpeedControl can save over 30% of battery by trading 10 min delay as compared to existing schemes when WiFi temporal coverage is 65%, moreover, the saving tendency increases as WiFi coverage increases.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-3360-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2014.6848173","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6848173","","Artificial neural networks;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Power demand;Network interfaces;Delays;Energy consumption;Algorithm design and analysis","energy consumption;mobile computing;power aware computing;smart phones;wireless LAN","CPU;trace-driven simulation;WiFi-3G interfaces;DVFS;energy-delay tradeoffs;wireless interface selection;SpeedControl scheme;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling problem;dynamic speed scaling;energy minimization;delay-tolerant smartphone","","23","","21","","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We also develop two localization algorithms, called PA-1 and PA-2. These algorithms are based on probabilistic framework assuming Gaussian PDF of error. PA-1 is more complex and is designed for the case when direction information is not measured in the online phase, while PA-2 is less complex and it can leverage direction information. Through manual calibration, a detailed fingerprinting database containing Received Signal Strength (RSS) values from 6 APs is developed at a grid spacing of 1m using three different smartphones and four different directions. In our experiments, we observe up to 30dBm temporal variations in RSS values at the same grid point. Furthermore, at 1m grid spacing, it becomes difficult to differentiate between RSS variations at neighboring grid points and RSS variations at the same grid point due to hardware and direction differences. We compare the localization accuracy of our algorithms with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. At 1m grid spacing, simple deterministic KNN algorithm outperforms more sophisticated probabilistic algorithms. However, when we increase the distance between neighboring grid points and make the grid spacing sparse (>1m), probabilistic algorithms perform better and labor-intensiveness of WIFI fingerprinting also decreases. We conclude that dense grid spacing is not always optimal and several performance-complexity tradeoffs can be achieved by carefully analyzing local RSS variations in the indoor environment.","","978-1-5386-7864-0","10.1109/ICCS.2018.8689182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8689182","","","indoor environment;indoor radio;nearest neighbour methods;probability;RSSI;smart phones;wireless LAN","empirical performance evaluation;indoor localization;realistic indoor environment;probabilistic framework;leverage direction information;RSS values;neighboring grid points;simple deterministic KNN algorithm;sophisticated probabilistic algorithms;grid spacing sparse;dense grid spacing;performance-complexity tradeoffs;local RSS variations;fingerprinting database;received signal strength;smartphones;temporal variations;K-nearest neighbors algorithm;WIFI fingerprinting;PA-1 localization algorithms;PA-2 localization algorithms;Gaussian PDF","","4","","10","","14 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the incompatible physical and medium access control layer, the low-power WSN suffers serious packet loss during the transmission. It raises the need for agile methods that can assess the channel conditions and assure the performance and robustness of wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we present a light-weight and self-adapting CTI mitigation strategy that quantifies the channel idle state and improves the packet reception rate (PRR) of the communication. Based on the background received signal strength indicator, we propose a new metric to quantify the constantly changing channel state in the temporal domain. We employ logistic regression as the machine learning classifier to decide whether the communication is viable over the interfered link. Through the collected Wi-Fi traffic, we find that the channel is idle in most of the time, which motivated the design of our scheme. Extensive experiments show that our scheme can achieve over 91% of the PRR, which gain the improvement of 40%.

Therefore, even if there exist many APs satisfying the QoS, the mobile devices selects a specific AP, thus, creating congestion on the AP's backhaul link.

In addition, by using data that have been collected by mounted sensors and cameras, the UAV can provide data-based application. However, these services usually use big data processing and machine learning techniques which require high computing power and the UAV is not sufficiently capable of process those applications due to lack of computing resources and battery limitation.

To this end, we decompose the localization algorithms in common phases (collection of raw measurements, creation of fingerprints, pattern matching and post-processing) and systematically asses the performance of different procedures that can be applied in each of these phases. We illustrate the application of the proposed methodology using a comprehensive experimental case-study of 3 WiFi fingerprinting algorithms with 4 raw RSSI collection procedures, 3 fingerprint creation and pattern matching procedures, 4 different post-processing procedures in 3 testbeds and 4 evaluation scenarios, resulting in 36 individual experiments. The results demonstrate that in the evaluated scenarios, a lower number of WiFi APs and rather simple fingerprint creation and pattern matching can achieve better performance in terms of location accuracy than more sophisticated alternatives.

In this paper, we propose a novel Wi-Fi signals based fatigue detection approach, called WiFind to overcome the drawbacks as associated with the current works. WiFind is simple and (wearable) device-free. It can detect the fatigue symptoms in the vehicle without relying on any visual image or video.

To address this issue, the model-free localization approach using deep learning framework has been proposed and the classification based technique is applied. In this paper, instead of using classification based mechanism, we propose to use a logistic regression based scheme under the deep learning framework, which is able to achieve sub-meter level accuracy (97.2cm medium distance error) in the standard laboratory environment and maintain reasonable online prediction overhead under the single WiFi AP settings.

To address these issues, a WiFi-enabled device-free human activity recognition system, namely SmartSense, is proposed in this paper. By upgrading commercial WiFi routers with our designed firmware, fine-grained channel state information (CSI) from PHY layer can be directly extracted from the existing WiFi traffic. In this paper, we propose SmartSense, a device-free human activity recognition system that only leverages existing commercial off-the-shelf WiFi routers. By exploiting the prevalence of WiFi infrastructure in buildings, we developed a novel CSI-enabled Internet of Things platform to collect the CSI measurements from regular data frames. To identify different human activities, a novel machine learning tool, namely multiple kernel semi-representation learning (MKSRL) method is established. MKSRL allows the input of expert domain knowledge in a flexible way and conducts automatic and effective multikernel representation learning for the activity recognition task. Each stage of MKSRL is computationally efficient and theoretically guaranteed, and they can be integrated seamlessly within the reproducing kernel framework for the overall information extraction, representation, and fusion. We conducted experiments to comprehensively evaluate the performance of SmartSense in three common indoor environments. Experimental results validate that SmartSense can provide an activity recognition accuracy of 98%, which achieves significant performance gain over the existing methods.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2019.2901927","2018 Seed Fund Award from CITRIS; University of California; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653883","Device-free;human activity recognition;multiple kernel semi-representation learning (MKSRL);WiFi","Wireless fidelity;Activity recognition;Internet of Things;Discrete wavelet transforms;Kernel;Buildings","intelligent sensors;Internet of Things;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication network routing;telecommunication traffic;wireless channels;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks","effective multikernel representation;SmartSense;smart buildings;human activity identification;WiFi-enabled device-free human activity recognition system;fine-grained channel state information;different human activities;multiple kernel semirepresentation learning method;WiFi traffic;CSI-enabled Internet;WiFi router infrastructure;PHY layer;MKSRL method;expert domain knowledge","","10","","34","IEEE","27 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Proximity does not require any additional infrastructure or specialized hardware and its efficiency is mainly attributed to a smart search space sharing technique we introduce. Its implementation is based on a novel data structure, coined k+-heap, which achieves constant O(1) look-up time and logarithmic O(log(k*λ)) insertion/update time. Proximity, being parameter-free, performs efficiently in the face of high mobility and skewed distribution of users (e.g., the service works equally well in downtown, suburban, or rural areas).

However, traditional Re-ID systems analyzing image or video sequences suffer from well-known issues such as illumination changes, occlusions, background clutter, and long-term re-identification. To simultaneously address all these difficult problems, we explore a Re-ID solution based on an alternative medium that is inherently not affected by them, i.e., the Wi-Fi technology. The latter, due to the widespread use of wireless communications, has grown rapidly and is already enabling the development of Wi-Fi sensing applications, such as human localization or counting. These sensing procedures generally exploit Wi-Fi signals variations that are a direct consequence, among other things, of human presence, and which can be observed through the channel state information (CSI) of Wi-Fi access points. Following this rationale, in this paper, for the first time in literature, we show how the pervasive Wi-Fi technology can also be directly exploited for person Re-ID. More accurately, Wi-Fi signals amplitude and phase are extracted from CSI measurements and analyzed through a two-branch deep neural network working in a siamese-like fashion. The designed pipeline can extract meaningful features from signals, i.e., radio biometric signatures, that ultimately allow the person Re-ID.

However, most studies on coexistence only consider the issues about downlink performance and fairness between WiFi network and LTE network. In this paper, we take a comprehensive consideration of both the performance of WiFi and LTE, to propose a downlink/uplink decoupling (DUDe) scheme for the fairness of the coexistence system. Through the process of modeling construction, problem formulation with reformulation, solution and simulations, we illustrate that DUDe can achieve proportional fairness in terms of sum throughput and load balancing between uplink and downlink. In our decoupling model for coexistence between WiFi and LTE, resource allocation is under adaptive spectrum partitioning and users can access each network of WiFi and LTE. Moreover, to make our proposal more realistic, we adopt support vector machine (SVM) to predict the total number of users in WiFi and LTE coexistence system, where the predictive simulation shows its high prediction accuracy with low complexity. We further apply the prediction results to the optimization problem of DUDe. Simulation results manifest that the proposed DUDe scheme has better performance in terms of sum throughput. The sum throughput of DUDe scheme can come up to almost twice more than that of coupled association scheme. The result shows that DUDe can also achieve load balance between uplink and downlink in the coexistence system.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2020.2976939","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61772287,61671252,61772286,61901229); Key University of Science Research Project of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:18KJA510004,19KJB510008); Jiangsu High Technology Research Key Laboratory for Wireless Sensor Networks(grant numbers:WSNLBKF 201802); Government of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BRA2017401); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9018137","Downlink/uplink decoupling;proportional fairness;support vector machine;coexistence system","Long Term Evolution;Wireless fidelity;Downlink;Uplink;Support vector machines;Throughput;Adaptation models","Long Term Evolution;optimisation;resource allocation;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","predicted decoupling;LTE network;downlink performance;WiFi network;coexistence system;sum throughput;DUDe scheme;uplink downlink;wireless fidelity;long term evolution;unlicensed band;downlink-uplink decoupling scheme;proportional fairness;load balancing;resource allocation;adaptive spectrum partitioning;SVM;support vector machine;DUDe optimization problem;coupled association scheme","","4","","56","IEEE","28 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, during training the system uses synchronized wireless and visual inputs, extracts pose information from the visual stream, and uses it to guide the training process. Once trained, the network uses only the wireless signal for pose estimation. We show that, when tested on visible scenes, the radio-based system is almost as accurate as the vision-based system used to train it.

In this paper, we propose a novel system SMART (Simultaneous Map Acquisition and Repeated Tracking) to address both problems. By tracking a subject based on sensor inputs and radio signals and detecting environmental fingerprints, SMART achieves simultaneous indoor localization and environment map construction using smartphones based on radio signals from surrounding WiFi access points and their own measured motion dynamics.

Current device-free passive localization systems either rely on deploying specialized systems with dense transmitter-receiver links with high economic cost or elaborating intensive training process with high labor cost. In this study, we explore the possibility of a ubiquitous WiFi-based device-free passive subarea localization(WiSal) via physical-layer channel response features without intensive site-survey based on a single link at the expense of some localization accuracy. The location of human can be estimated by leveraging K-Nearest Neighbor(KNN) algorithm based on signal change features of different subareas that are achieved by a hierarchical clustering algorithm.

The Multidimensional-Scaling Growing Clustering (MSGC) algorithm is employed to generate fuzzy rules flexibly without any prior knowledge. In order to maintain a compact and interpretable fuzzy rule base, the membership functions are merged according to the similarity of membership degree, and the consequent parameters are tuned by using the recursive linear-least-squares (RLS) algorithm. The gauss kernel function is adopted to weight different APs, and the iterative method is employed to assign weights for APs in different regions.

Our approach, called Impairment Shift Keying (ISK), introduces small yet controlled modifications to the radio transmitter hardware, which distorts regular standards-compliant waveforms, such as WiFi, with only 1% increase in bit error rate. A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained to learn these overlay signal variations, which serves as a low-overhead classifier returning a binary 0 or 1 per detected impairment pattern. By mapping device-specific injected impairment patterns to signal variations, ISK validates device IDs with only few inphase (I) and quadrature (Q) samples. Furthermore, through an experimental testbed, ISK is shown to be resilient to channel and SNR level variations, allowing a throughput of 93-1500 Kbps on the covert channel that is undetected by other receivers.","2155-7586","978-1-7281-4280-7","10.1109/MILCOM47813.2019.9021079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9021079","","Radio transmitters;Receivers;Wireless communication;Wireless fidelity;Standards;Modulation;Convolution","convolutional neural nets;learning (artificial intelligence);radio transmitters;software radio;telecommunication computing;telecommunication security","deep learning;controlled radio imperfections;wireless spectrum;software-defined radios;SDRs;covert wireless communications;private information;ISK;radio transmitter hardware;regular standards-compliant waveforms;bit error rate;deep convolutional neural network;overlay signal variations;low-overhead classifier;device IDs;covert channel;impairment shift keying;device-specific injected impairment patterns;covert signaling;eavesdropping","","2","","18","","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, with the flourish development of computer vision technology, image recognition technology has been rather qualified to process many kind of images, as so the application of image recognition technology be used in wireless sensing data processing is a reasonable innovation. By this means, not only the calculation cost has been saved, but also both the accuracy and the scale of the problem has been improved. In this paper, a model called C-WiFi is proposed, which is brand-new. In this model, the traditional method of Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) is declined and with the CSI measurements converted into the spectrum diagram.

Among these wireless signals, UWB (Ultra-Wide-Band) is recognized as the most promising technology to construct IPS with decimeter-level positioning accuracy. However, there are various objects in indoor environments, UWB signals might be reflected by these surrounding objects. These None-Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) signals will induce additional errors to the distance measurements between the anchor and agent. Therefore, NLOS/LOS (Line-Of-Sight) signals classification should be carried out for identifying the NLOS reception. In UWB based IPS, the distance information is extracted through the Channel Impulse Response (CIR) waveforms. NLOS reception will lead to different CIR waveforms compared with that from the LOS signal, this difference could be characterized for NLOS/LOS signals classification. However, the hardware circuits, signal transmitting path and the NLOS reception will bring about noises to the CIR waveforms, which might influence the signal type identification. Motivated by this problem, in this letter, a reversible transformation method was proposed for de-nosing the CIR data, and a Conventional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to identify the NLOS signal. Raw and de-noised CIR dataset were both input to the CNN for assessing the effect of the de-noising method. With dataset collected from seven different sites, the results showed that the reversible transformation method was able to increase the Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) values of these CIR datasets. After the de-noising, the CNN performed higher classification accuracy with less convolutional layers. Moreover, the de-noising operation brought about higher NLOS signal identification accuracy increase than that of LOS signals.","1558-2558","","10.1109/LCOMM.2020.3009659","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61601225); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9142254","UWB;NLOS;CNN;de-noising","Noise reduction;Signal to noise ratio;Feature extraction;Distance measurement;IP networks;Convolution;Boosting","convolutional neural nets;indoor navigation;radionavigation;signal classification;telecommunication computing;transient response;ultra wideband communication","NLOS-LOS signal classification;ultrawideband communication;convolutional layers;conventional neural network;CIR waveforms;channel impulse response waveforms;distance information;UWB based IPS;distance measurements;none-line-of-sight signal classification;UWB signals;indoor environments;decimeter-level positioning accuracy;Indoor Positioning System;wireless signals;indoor position information;UWB channel impulse response denoising method;CIR datasets;signal noise ratio values;de-noised CIR dataset;NLOS signal;CNN;CIR data denoising;reversible transformation method;signal type identification;NLOS reception","","6","","19","IEEE","16 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This way, devices can be directly identified at the physical layer by analyzing the unprocessed received waveform - thus avoiding energy-expensive upper-layer cryptography that resource-challenged embedded devices may not be able to afford. Recent advances have proven that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) - thanks to their multidimensional mappings - can achieve fingerprinting accuracy levels impossible to achieve by traditional low-dimensional algorithms. The same research, however, has also suggested that the wireless channel may negatively impact the accuracy of CNN-based radio fingerprinting algorithms by making device-unique hardware imperfections much harder to recognize.In spite of the growing interest in radio fingerprinting research by academia and DARPA, the wireless research community still lacks (i) a large-scale open dataset for radio fingerprinting collected in diverse environments and rich, diverse, channel conditions; and (ii) a full-fledged, systematic, quantitative investigation of the impact of the wireless channel on the accuracy of CNN-based radio fingerprinting algorithms. The key contribution of this paper is to bridge this gap by (i) collecting and sharing with the community more than 7TB of wireless data obtained from 20 wireless devices with identical RF circuitry (and thus, worst-case scenario for fingerprinting) over the course of several days in (a) an anechoic chamber, (b) in-the-wild testbed, and (c) with cable connections; and (ii) providing a first-of-its-kind evaluation of the impact of the wireless channel on CNN-based fingerprinting algorithms through (a) the 7TB experimental dataset and (b) a 400GB dataset provided by DARPA containing hundreds of thousands of transmissions from thousands of WiFi and ADS-B devices with different SNR conditions. Experimental results conclude that (i) the wireless channel impacts the classification accuracy significantly, i.e., from 85% to 9% and from 30% to 17% in the experimental and DARPA dataset, respectively; and that (ii) equalizing I/Q data can increase the accuracy to a significant extent (i.e., by up to 23%) when the number of devices increases significantly.","2641-9874","978-1-7281-6412-0","10.1109/INFOCOM41043.2020.9155259","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155259","","Wireless communication;Radio frequency;Hardware;Wireless fidelity;Performance evaluation;Kernel;Anechoic chambers","convolutional neural nets;cryptography;fingerprint identification;wireless channels;wireless LAN","diverse channel conditions;wireless channel;CNN-based radio fingerprinting algorithms;wireless data;wireless devices;ADS-B devices;tiny hardware-level imperfections;off-the-shelf radio circuitry;energy-expensive upper-layer cryptography;resource-challenged embedded devices;device-unique hardware imperfections;radio fingerprinting research;wireless research community;rich channel conditions;DARPA;anechoic chamber;SNR conditions;convolutional neural networks;multidimensional mappings;memory size 400.0 GByte","","26","","34","","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, four features that can depict the relationship between the number of people and data fluctuation are extracted and analyzed. Eventually, the selected features are labeled and taken as inputs of several machine learning algorithms.

Perspective developments in the field of IP communications are connected with the creation of integrated solutions that allow the development of next-generation networks to maintain existing connections and ensure uninterrupted operation in any telephone access network: on the infrastructure of copper pairs, through optical channels, wireless (WiMAX, WiFi) and wired (ETTH, PLC and etc.) of the network. According to the concept of “non-destructive” transition to NGN, such solutions should allow point-to-point transfer of certain segments to new technologies in radiofrequency applications without drastically changing the entire structure of the network. In particular, solutions for a “nondestructive” transition to NGN must meet the following requirements: • Integration into the existing network of the operator, support not only for new transport technology, but also for the familiar management model; • Fully modular architecture with the capabilities of geographical distribution and redundancy; • The ability to flexibly increase productivity by purchasing licenses and adding servers to the system; • The possibility of introducing new types of services in the shortest possible time; • Compliance with the requirements of the legislation on network architecture [1-5]. Routing to date is determined not by formal rules and descriptions typical of networks of previous generations, but by customer requirements and economic considerations of the telecoms operator. To optimize the operation of networks in radiofrequency applications, various routing methods are being developed, ensuring a balanced load of all network resources. Among foreign scholars studying this problem, it is worthwhile to highlight D. Awduche, J. Malcolm, J. Agogbua, M. O'Dell, J. McManus, S. Hiroyuki, M. Yasuhiro, Y. Makiko and others. The main requirement in this case is that the new systems are maximally adapted to the transmission of packet traffic and primarily IP-messages. To successfully transmit across the network information flows of various types, it is necessary that the routing algorithm takes into account the requirements of these flows to the level of quality of service (QoS). To do this, all traffic is divided into service classes. And then routing across the network will be carried out in accordance with the service class of each individual thread. In Russia, issues of routing and related problems are handled by B.S. Goldstein, VM Vishnevsky, Yu.A. Semenov, VN Tarasov, AV Roslyakov, and others[1-5]. To obtain the optimal solution, it is necessary to simultaneously examine all the flows on a full set of routes. However, in multiservice networks with a large number of nodes, the size of the routing task can be very significant at the same time, which will not solve it in an acceptable time. Therefore, the task of developing new methods of adaptive routing is relevant. Routing in radiofrequency applications is one of the most important mechanisms for sending packets over computer networks. Routing solves two problems: combating network congestion and finding the shortest paths for transferring packets. The main factors influencing the choice of the router path are faults (when the node or communication channel fails) and overloading (when any part of the network is overloaded and it is desirable to redirect the packets to bypass)[6].","","978-1-5386-5622-8","10.1109/SOSG.2018.8350602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8350602","routing;network routing;routing table;routing protocols;routing adjustment;ip routing;dynamic routing;data routing in radiofrequency applications","Routing;Task analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Routing protocols;Radio frequency;Optimization;Control systems","broadband networks;computer network management;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);packet switching;quality of service;radio networks;telecommunication network routing;telecommunication services;telecommunication traffic;WiMax","optimal traffic routing;radiofrequency applications;NGN;next-generation networks;telephone access network;nondestructive transition;point-to-point transfer;network resources;network information flows;routing algorithm;multiservice networks;adaptive routing;computer networks;network congestion","","","","9","","30 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study reports on the implementation of a multimodal bio-signal control system for an electric wheelchair.

It is referred to as A Fast-Accurate-Reliable Localization System (AFARLS). AFARLS exploits the speed advantage of COSELM to reduce the computational cost, and the accuracy advantage of WSRC to enhance the classification performance, by utilizing KNN as the adaptive sub-dictionary selection strategy. The understanding is that the original extreme learning machine (ELM) is less robust against noise, while sparse representation classification (SRC) and KNN suffer a high computational burden when using the over-complete dictionary. AFARLS unifies their complementary strengths to resolve each other’s limitation. In large-scale multi-building and multi-floor environments, AFARLS estimates a location that considers the building, floor, and position (longitude and latitude) in a hierarchical and sequential approach according to a discriminative criterion to the COSELM output. If the classifier result is unreliable, AFARLS uses KNN to achieve the best relevant sub-dictionary. The sub-dictionary is fed to WSRC to re-estimate the building and the floor, while the position is predicted by the ELM regressor. AFARLS has been verified on two publicly available datasets, the <italic>EU Zenodo</italic> and the <italic>UJIIndoorLoc</italic>.

At first, the radio signatures have been collected at few positions from the environment in a usual manner after that based on collected data, the KOS-ELM algorithm has been trained.

The feature extraction algorithm reduces dimensionality of sparse measurement vector, and it is applied to detect floor level and designated landmarks. Also, the combination of the feature extraction and the GP regression is used for modeling nonlinear relationship between location and measurement. By this combination, locations of Wi-Fi access points are not required to be known.

However, Google QUIC (GQUIC), follows “WiFi-First” policy causing frequent network switching, which can lead to a throughput reduction and fast battery degradation. In this paper, we propose Cross-layer QUIC (CQUIC) framework, that follows “WiFi-if-best” policy to enhance the throughput and resilience by using a Cross-Layer approach. CQUIC proposes a novel migration scheme in QUIC which adapts to the dynamic network characteristics. GQUIC protocol with low bandwidth and high round-trip-time fail to migrate for seamless User Experience. CQUIC algorithm predicts Cross-Layer Score (CLS) which incorporates predicted Signal-to-Interference Noise Ratio (SINR), QUIC Bandwidth, round-triptime (RTT) stats from QUIC Session and models the handover decision pro-actively.

The problem is further exacerbated by device heterogeneity occurring across various mobile devices. In this article, we present a unified deep neural network (DNN)-based solution, termed DHCLoc, to address these two challenges. To be specific, a Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB)-based analysis reveals that utilizing multichannel information will benefit localization, motivating us to include channel information into DHCLoc. Moreover, a novel maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)-based localization framework is introduced by incorporating a new variable to characterize the RSS measurement offsets caused by device heterogeneity, inspiring us to apply adversarial training to adopt such offsets against device heterogeneity.

A new weighted algorithm based on physical distance is then presented for position determination. With angle velocity measurement provided such as by gyroscope, the weighted algorithm is particularly suited for scenarios where the mobile moves along a trajectory. The number of clusters in traditional RP clustering algorithms needs to be predefined, which means an unsuitable number of clusters would lead to poor estimation accuracy. Traditional weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN) algorithm weights the RPs' coordinates by the inverse of the received signal strength indication (RSSI) difference, which is not accurate enough because of the exponential relationship between RSSI and physical distance. Furthermore, methods based on probabilistic model or data fusion do not consider the uneven spatial resolution of Wi-Fi RSSI. Experimental results show that the proposed weighted algorithm considerably outperforms the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Euclidean-WKNN, ManhattanWKNN, EWKNN, LiFS, and GPR in terms of positioning accuracy which is defined as the cumulative distribution function of position error. The results also demonstrate that RPs in indoor area without linear constraints can be clustered automatically by the proposed clustering algorithm, and cumulative distribution function of the proposed clustering algorithm outperforms KNN, WKNN, RP location clustered, and signal distance clustered.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2018.2829486","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0502204); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:41374011,41674005,41574031,41730109,91546106,41701519); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2017A030310544); Open Research Fund Program of State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing(grant numbers:16I02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8345271","Physical distance;reference point (RP) clustering;uneven spatial resolution;virtual position (VP) of access points (APs);weighted K-nearest neighbor (WKNN)","Clustering algorithms;Euclidean distance;Wireless fidelity;Gyroscopes;Probabilistic logic;Fingerprint recognition;Turning","indoor navigation;indoor radio;RSSI;wireless LAN","indoor Wi-Fi positioning;physical distance-based weighting;positioning accuracy;Wi-Fi RSSI;received signal strength indication difference;weighted algorithm;online phase positioning;offline phase clustering;indoor localization;access points;virtual positions-based reference point clustering;linear constraints","","18","","38","IEEE","23 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These features extracted are recognized using particle swarm optimization (PSO) tuned twin support vector machines (TSVM) classifier. The TSVM classifier is four times faster than the standard SVM while the PSO technique is employed to gradually tune the classifier parameters to achieve more accuracy. The proposed methodology is implemented on IoT based microcontroller platform and validated on the benchmark Physionet data to classify 16 categories of ECG signals. Once an abnormality is detected, the platform generates a pop-up message as a warning and sends the information to a remote platform allowing hospitals to take preventive measures. The platform reported a higher overall accuracy of 95.68% than the existing studies.

The number of people aged 60 years or over is at its highest, and it's expected to double by 2050. With age, people frequently experience difficulties in mobility, requiring them to use assistive technology, from wearable devices to mobile devices such as wheelchairs or walkers. Recently, power-assisted versions of these systems have been developed to further enhance the provided assistance, such as electric wheelchairs and power-assisted walkers. In scenarios such as shopping malls or airports, people often need to walk long distances to reach their destination, so these power-assisted systems can help them move without difficulties. However, these systems are still quite expensive, and having one device per user might prove difficult. To overcome this, these facilities could have a reduced number of devices and allow users to share them upon request. However, it's not desirable to have each user move toward the assistive device due to their limited mobility. Instead, in this research we propose a method to enable the device to navigate toward the user upon request by using onboard sensors and the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure. Specifically, we create a map with the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) of existing Wi-Fi access points (using a method called Fingerprinting). When a user requests an assistive device, the RSSI values at the user's position are sent to it, and the device determines the rough position of the user using a KNN algorithm. However, typical Fingerprinting methods are affected by infrastructural changes which alter the profile of RSSI values at each location. Therefore, we propose that the map is constantly updated while the device moves in order to avoid errors due to changes in the infrastructure. Through experiments we confirmed that the device could locate the position where the request originated with an error of 2.612 m, and it was able to navigate towards it.","2474-2325","978-1-7281-6667-4","10.1109/SII46433.2020.9025862","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9025862","","Wireless fidelity;Databases;Wheelchairs;Real-time systems;Navigation;Classification algorithms;Fingerprint recognition","fingerprint identification;handicapped aids;indoor radio;mobile radio;RSSI;wheelchairs;wireless LAN","electric wheelchair;power-assisted walkers;shopping malls;airports;assistive device;Wi-Fi infrastructure;RSSI values;indoor wayfinding;Wi-Fi fingerprinting localization;wearable devices;mobile devices;electric wheelchair;received signal strength indicator;size 2.612 m","","","","17","","9 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the existing deep learning work has posed the problem as closed set classification, where a neural network classifies among a finite set of known transmitters. No matter how large this set is, it will not include all transmitters that exist. Malicious transmitters outside this closed set, once within communications range, can jeopardize the system security. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for transmitter authorization based on open set recognition. Our proposed approach identifies a set of authorized transmitters, while rejecting any other unseen transmitters by recognizing their signals as outliers. We propose three approaches for this problem and show their ability to reject signals from unauthorized transmitters on a dataset of WiFi captures.

To this end, WiFi-based material identification approach has emerged recently as a low-cost yet effective alternative. In this paper, we propose WiMate, a noncontact material identification system leveraging only off-the-shelf WiFi devices. The key enabler of WiMate is a novel theoretical model we build to characterize how the electromagnetic wave decays when penetrating different materials. Our model identifies a unique feature for each material that only depends on the material itself. Consequently, we can leverage this feature coupling with the machine learning techniques for robust and accurate material identification. We prototype WiMate using low-cost commodity WiFi devices and evaluate its performance in real-world. The empirical study shows that WiMate can identify six different materials, i.e., board, paperboard, nickel, wood chip, iron and titanium, with an average accuracy of 96.20%.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685094","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685094","Channel State Information (CSI);WiFi;Material Identification","Performance evaluation;Ultrasonic imaging;Prototypes;Titanium;Physical layer;Nickel;Object recognition","","","","","","15","","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by developing a supervised machine learning model that learns from user preferences for different types of content, and propensity to be guided by the user interface of the player, and predictively preload entire TV shows. Testing on a data set of nearly 3.9 million sessions from all over the U.K. to BBC TV shows, we find that predictive preloading can save over 71% of the mobile data for an average user.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2016.2577298","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/K024914/1); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/K024914/1); Projects 5G NORMA and VirtuWind(grant numbers:H2020-ICT-2014-2); EU–India REACH Project(grant numbers:ICI+/2014/342-986); King’s Undergraduate Research Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7485863","Video streaming;predictive preloading;content delivery;mobile prefetching;supervised learning;catch-up TV","Mobile communication;IEEE 802.11 Standard;TV;Streaming media;Mobile handsets;Internet;Bandwidth","cellular radio;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;television broadcasting;user interfaces;video streaming;wireless LAN","take-away TV;predictive preloading;catch-up TV content;mobile data offloading;cellular data networks;Wi-Fi connectivity;Wi-Fi access;mobile devices;cellular data access;supervised machine learning model;user interface;U.K;BBC TV shows","","20","","34","CCBY","6 Jun 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To extract the motion change pattern in real time, we develop an efficient method based on the seam carving algorithm. Moreover, taking as input the motion change pattern, a deep neural network (DNN) is adopted for both gesture recognition and user identification tasks. In DNN, we apply splitting and splicing schemes to optimize collaborative learning for dual tasks. We implement WiHF and extensively evaluate its performance on a public dataset including 6 users and 6 gestures performed across 5 locations and 5 orientations in 3 environments. Experimental results show that WiHF achieves 97.65 and 96.74 percent for in-domain gesture recognition and user identification accuracy, respectively.

Apparently, the monetary implications of the clinics and hospitals are recent apprehensions globally. Also, the increasing world population is leading to the occurrence of various chronic heart diseases. Consequently, more people fall ill, hospitals are not vacant hence increasing the death rate. Consequently, a medical system which includes point-of-care is the need of the hour. The medical system should be able to handle long-term and continuous monitoring, inconspicuous monitoring and should be highly sensitive to the patient's ECG signal. Therefore, to resolve this matter, we can club together the concept of Nanoelectronics, Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data. Essentially, the nanomaterial enabled ECG sensors/devices have certainly improved conductivity, electrical properties, the toxicity of the devices. It has also reduced the cost, it is easily and abundantly available, and can be effortlessly integrated with the latest technological devices and concepts like IoT and Big Data. IoT helps the ECG signals to get transmitted through the sensor via a gateway using communication protocols like Bluetooth, Zigbee, 3G/4G, Wi-Fi, LAN, etc. Then this data can be sent to numerous places like the doctor's end, caregiver or the cloud-storage for analysis or processing, etc. The doctor at the remote location can view the patient's report on various smart devices, all thanks to the computing technology. This helps in dealing with the emergencies. Leading on to this, Big Data plays a pivotal role in this system as it provides with data analysis, decision-making, extracting useful information via algorithms, intelligent storage etc. The combination of these three technologies will make the world a more secure place to live.","","978-1-7281-0211-5","10.1109/COMITCon.2019.8862197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8862197","Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs);IoT (Internet of Things);Big Data;Electrocardiogram (ECG);Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs);SWCNT (Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes);MWCNT (Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes)","Electrodes;Electrocardiography;Skin;Medical services;Monitoring;Big Data;Internet of Things","Bluetooth;data analysis;diseases;electrocardiography;health care;Internet of Things;medical signal processing;nanoelectronics;patient monitoring;sensors;telemedicine;Zigbee","world population;IoT;cardiovascular diseases;big data;monetary implications;social regiment;ECG monitoring;smart healthcare;decision-making;smart devices;ECG signals;inconspicuous monitoring;continuous monitoring;point-of-care;medical system;death rate;hospitals;chronic heart diseases","","16","","68","","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, our pilot experiment shows that the video frame latency, dominant component of PL's interactive latency, can be significantly slowed down by WiFi, the primary Internet access method for PL. Understanding and further improving the frame latency over WiFi, however, have difficulties in 1) measuring end-to-end latency; 2) parsing encrypted PL's traffic and 3) modeling complex relationships between WiFi radio factors and the latency. To tackle these challenges, we design and prototype Latency Doctor (LTDr), a practical system which aims to model and optimize PL's video frame latency over WiFi. We deploy LTDr in our campus and obtain several key observations based on 13.9M video frames extracted from 12K individual views on three leading PLs in China. We observe that 40% frame latencies over WiFi hop are more than 30ms, and channel utilization should be less than 64% for low latency. Then we build a predictive model based on the dataset using the machine learning methodologies. Two real cases show that the median frame latencies are decreased by LTDr from 130ms to 22ms, and 50ms to 12ms respectively over WiFi networks.","2374-9628","978-1-5386-6808-5","10.1109/PCCC.2018.8710767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710767","","Wireless fidelity;Streaming media;Media;Servers;Predictive models;Portable computers;User experience","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);video streaming;wireless LAN","popular personalized livestreaming;WiFi radio factors;video frame latency;Internet access method;end-to-end latency;encrypted personalized streaming traffic parsing;Latency Doctor;LTDr","","1","","19","","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since CSI is much sensitive to ambient changes, CSI can be used as fingerprints as human activities. However, existing approaches require tremendous overhead in the model training and suffer from failures due to environmental interferences. In this paper, we propose HAR, a CSI based human activity recognition system. HAR investigates the CSI intra-correlation structure (termed as topics) of different human activities. We leverage an unsupervised machine learning method, namely topic model, to extract action characters. Compared to prior works, HAR only requests minor manual intervention, significantly reducing manpower costs in the model training. We implement HAR using commodity WiFi devices to evaluate its performance under different environment settings. The results show that the extracted features are stable to different devices and volunteers, facilitating HAR to achieving an average matching accuracy, i.e., > 90%.","","978-1-5090-5696-5","10.1109/MSN.2016.012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7950206","Topic Model;activity recognition;CSI","Activity recognition;Wireless fidelity;Training;Feature extraction;Indexes;Wireless communication;Semantics","fingerprint identification;human computer interaction;learning (artificial intelligence);radiofrequency interference;radiowave propagation;wireless LAN","CSI based human activity recognition;leveraging topic model;human-computer interactions;channel state information;fine-grained information;WiFi signal propagation;device-free pattern;human activity fingerprints;environmental interferences;CSI intra-correlation structure;unsupervised machine learning;WiFi devices","","1","","29","","19 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, accurately extracting features that are independent of the complicated underwater environments such as inhomogeneous deep seawater is a serious challenge for underwater motion recognition. Velocities of target body (VTB) during the motion are excellent environment independent features for WiFi-based recognition techniques in the indoor environments, however, VTB features are hard to be extracted accurately in the underwater environments. The inaccurate VTB estimation is caused by the fact that the signal propagates along with a curve instead of a straight line as the signal propagates in the air. In this paper, we propose an underwater motion recognition mechanism in the inhomogeneous deep seawater using acoustic wireless networks. To accurately extract velocities of target body features, we first derive Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) coefficients that can be utilized for VTB estimation when signals propagate deviously. Secondly, we propose a dynamic self-refining (DSR) optimization algorithm with acoustic wireless networks that consist of multiple transmitter-receiver links to estimate the VTB. Those VTB features can be utilized to train the convolutional neural networks (CNN). Through the simulation, estimated VTB features are evaluated and the testing recognition results validate that our proposed underwater motion recognition mechanism is able to achieve high classification accuracy.","1938-1883","978-1-7281-5089-5","10.1109/ICC40277.2020.9148998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9148998","","Acoustics;Receivers;Transmitters;Feature extraction;Estimation;Doppler effect;Wireless networks","convolutional neural nets;Doppler shift;feature extraction;image classification;image motion analysis;optimisation;underwater acoustic communication","inaccurate VTB estimation;indoor environments;WiFi-based recognition techniques;excellent environment independent features;complicated underwater environments;image-based underwater classification techniques;expensive underwater cameras;aquatic animal recognition;diver activity monitoring;activity recognition;testing recognition results;estimated VTB features;target body features;acoustic wireless networks;inhomogeneous deep seawater;underwater motion recognition mechanism;signal propagates","","","","11","","27 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The goal is to minimize prediction errors for classification-based mobile crowdsensing tasks subject to upload and query cost constraints. Novel stream-based active learning strategies are developed to orchestrate queries of annotation data and the upload of unlabeled data from mobile devices.

However, for practical deployment, it needs to greatly enhance the performance robustness against dynamic changes of the surrounding environment. To address this problem, we propose a novel CSI based activity recognition using Roaming Generator (CSIRoG) system for human activity detection. CSIRoG leverages existing WiFi infrastructures and monitors human behaviours from CSI measurements. It utilizes the generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer the CSI information from one environment to another with dynamic changes such as people passing by, furniture layout changes, etc. The proposed method aims to approximate the CSI distribution in the new environment setting which has very limited CSI data. Therefore, the system can learn to handle multiple environment dynamics. Compared to the existing works, CSIRoG leverages a multimodal system model for better diversity of the generated CSI data for knowledge transfer. This improves the ability of CSIRoG to recognize various kinds of CSI information for one specific user activity caused by various dynamic conditions, thus enhancing system robustness. We have tested CSIRoG under multiple environment settings at different places. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes environmental dynamics and outperforms existing human activity recognition systems.","","978-1-7281-7709-0","10.1109/ICARCV50220.2020.9305332","Agency for Science, Technology and Research (Singapore); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9305332","","Generators;Training;Activity recognition;Data models;Wireless fidelity;Training data;Layout","neural nets;signal detection;telecommunication network planning;wireless LAN","robust CSI-based human activity recognition;Roaming Generator;Channel State Information;CSIRoG;human activity detection;CSI measurements;generative adversarial network;CSI information;multimodal system model;generated CSI data;human activity recognition systems;CSI based activity recognition;environment dynamics;WiFi infrastructures;GAN","","","","31","","8 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a learning based approach for performing network selection based on real-network implementations. The main contributions are first, presenting an approach for building training data as a basis for machine learning of network selection and then developing the classification model for network selection. The model considers the features that affect the selection decision known by the user: availability of the networks, signal strength reflecting the channel quality, data size, battery life, speed of the user, location, and type of application. The training data set is based on experimental measurements of WiFi and 3G links using a Samsung Galaxy SII device. The network class annotation chooses the network that provides the user either highest QoS, lowest energy consumption or highest energy efficiency based on its current features status and service requirements.

However, unpredictable network conditions, such as congestion and link quality, can severely degrade the quality of experience (QoE). While buffer-based mitigations cannot be applied to real-time applications due to their immediate resource needs, recent innovations in network slicing have demonstrated the feasibility of dedicating specified amounts of network resources to individual sessions in the radio access network. Encouraged by this, we propose to reserve network resources for multimedia sessions in real time according to their declared needs, thereby providing ad hoc session-level performance guarantees. Through Wi-Fi experiments and trace-driven LTE simulations, we show that such session-level resource provisioning is robust to real-time channel fluctuations and congestion externalities over the lifetime of a session. This approach, however, raises challenges: how can the network ensure that users are honest about their resource needs and optimally allocate its limited resources to users under uncertainty in future sessions' resource needs? We derive a novel multi-unit combinatorial auction (MUCA) model with a unique structure that can be exploited for fast winner determination, and yet incentivize truthful bidding, properties not simultaneously achieved in a generic MUCA but essential to making real-time session guarantees. Furthermore, since dynamic bidding in real time is challenging for end-users who are budget-constrained, we develop a reinforcement learning-based utility-maximizing strategy to distribute their budget across sessions and show that it yields high user utility.","1558-0008","","10.1109/JSAC.2019.2916487","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1751075); DARPA(grant numbers:HR001117C0048); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732668","Quality of service;5G mobile communication;resource management;economics;machine learning;network slicing;auction theory;reinforcement learning;performance guarantees","Real-time systems;Streaming media;Quality of experience;Bit rate;Wireless communication;Long Term Evolution;Resource management","combinatorial mathematics;electronic commerce;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;multimedia communication;optimisation;quality of experience;quality of service;radio access networks;resource allocation;video streaming;wireless LAN","procuring spontaneous session-level resource guarantees;real-time applications;auction approach;real-time multimedia applications;interactive gaming;live video streaming;bitrate requirements;unpredictable network conditions;link quality;network slicing;network resources;individual sessions;radio access network;multimedia sessions;ad hoc session-level performance guarantees;session-level resource provisioning;real-time channel fluctuations;congestion externalities;future sessions;novel multiunit combinatorial auction model;real-time session guarantees;Wi-Fi experiments;trace-driven LTE simulations;reinforcement learning-based utility-maximizing strategy","","5","","45","IEEE","6 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Based on three hypotheses on CSI, the DeepFi system architecture includes an offline training phase and an online localization phase. In the offline training phase, deep learning is utilized to train all the weights of a deep network as fingerprints.

In this paper, we present a new gesture recognition system by leveraging the channel state information (CSI) which can be extracted from commodity Wi-Fi device. We design a novel interference elimination algorithm to diminish the influence caused by the signals reflected from static objects and the signal that travels from the transmitter to the receiver directly. After interference elimination, the system can capture the signal reflected from the hand and sample this signal. Then, the sample values are used to construct a virtual antenna array to estimate the moving trajectory of hand. At last, we use Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the trajectories and complete the gesture recognition. The extensive analytical and experimental results demonstrate our system can achieve an average accuracy of 0.97 for designed 6 single-hand gestures.

To address this problem in a less constrained scope of environments, we introduce the concept of similarity of simultaneous observation where the user utilizes a camera (Wi-Fi camera, camera on a mobile phone or laptop) to compare timing patterns of data transmitted by potentially hidden cameras and the timing patterns that are expected from the scene that the known camera is recording. To analyze the patterns, we applied several similarity measures and demonstrated an accuracy of over 87% and and F1 score of 0.88 using an efficient threshold-based classification. Furthermore, we used our data set to train a neural network and saw improved results with accuracy as high as 97% and an F1 score over 0.95 for both indoors and outdoors settings.

In this paper, we propose DeepRemote, a smart remote controller that can recognize various home appliances and operate them through IR or network. DeepRemote mounts a camera, an infrared (IR) transceiver, Wi-Fi module, four buttons, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a speaker. To recognize a target home appliance, the user just points DeepRemote to the appliance intuitively. After recognition, it automatically enters a particular mode to operate the known home appliance. Then the user can control it through a simple interface using buttons and gestures.

We exploit an encoder-decoder-encoder neural network for latent feature extraction. Afterward, an adversarial training scheme is employed to minimize the reconstruction error both within RSSI space and latent feature space. The higher reconstruction deviation of the RSSI vector is indicative of an anomaly from a normal distribution.

The solution builds upon a new abstraction, named Transmission Policy which allows the SDN controller to reconfigure or replace a certain rate control policy if its optimal operating conditions are not met. An experimental evaluation carried out over a real-world testbed shows that this approach can deliver an improvement of up to 80% in terms of channel utilization compared to legacy 802.11 multicast. We release the entire implementation including the controller and the data-path under a permissive license for academic use.","","978-3-901882-89-0","10.23919/INM.2017.7987288","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7987288","WLANs;IEEE 802.11;multicast;rate adaptation;software defined networking","Reliability;Artificial neural networks","computer network management;multicast communication;multimedia systems;software defined networking;wireless LAN","software defined enterprise WLAN;wireless multicasting;multimedia content;live broadcasting;multicast applications;Wi-Fi networks;software defined networking;network control;network management;transmission policy;SDN controller;channel utilization","","5","","22","","24 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It deduces the state of a person by analyzing his/her influence on surrounding wireless signals. Therefore, how to characterize the influence of human behaviors is the key question. In this paper, we explore and exploit a radio image processing approach to better characterize the influence of human behaviors on Wi-Fi signals. Traditional methods deal with channel state information (CSI) measurements on each channel independently. However, CSI measurements on different channels are correlated, and thus lots of useful information involved with channel correlation may be lost. This motivates us to look on CSI measurements from multiple channels as a radio image and deal with it from the two-dimensional perspective. Specifically, we transform CSI measurements from multiple channels into a radio image, extract color and texture features from the radio image, adopt a deep learning network to learn optimized deep features from image features, and estimate the location and activity of a person using a machine learning approach. Benefits from the informative and discriminative deep image features and experimental results in two clutter laboratories confirm the excellent performance of the proposed system.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2017.2737553","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61671102,61401059); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT17JC03,DUT17RC(3)024,DUT16QY33); Scientific Research Staring Foundation; Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars; Xinghai Scholars Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8004463","Activity recognition;device-free;feature extraction;localization;radio image","Feature extraction;Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless fidelity;Machine learning;Activity recognition","feature extraction;image colour analysis;image recognition;image texture;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence)","image features;radio image processing;wireless signals;radio image features;activity recognition;device-free wireless localization;channel state information measurements;human behaviors","","100","","38","IEEE","8 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In railways, trains are now equipped with wireless communication systems for operational purposes or for passenger services. In both cases, defense strategies have to be developed to prevent the misuses of the networks. The first objective of this study is to propose a monitoring solution, which is independent of the communication networks, to detect the occurrence of attacks. The second objective is to develop a method that is able to classify attacks of different types: the intentional electromagnetic interference, i.e., jamming attacks and the protocol-based attacks. This study focuses on the IEEE 802.11n Wi-Fi protocol. To perform these analyses, we propose to monitor and to analyze electromagnetic (EM) signals received by a monitoring antenna and a receiver collecting the EM spectra. After that, we build a classification protocol following two steps: the first consists in the construction of a support vector machine (SVM) classification model using the collected spectra, and the second step uses this SVM model to predict the class of the attack (if any).

DeepVehicleSense aims at achieving three performance objectives: high accuracy, low latency, and low power consumption at once by exploiting sound characteristics captured from the built-in microphone while being on candidate transportations. To attain high energy efficiency, DeepVehicleSense adopts hierarchical accelerometer-based triggers that minimize the activation of the microphone of smartphones. Further, to achieve high accuracy and low latency, DeepVehicleSense makes use of non-linear filters that can best extract the transportation sound samples. For recognition of five different transportation modes, we design a deep learning based sound classifier using a novel deep neural network architecture with multiple branches. Our staged inference technique can significantly reduce runtime and energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy for the majority of samples.

WiCluster can predict both a zone-level position and a precise 2D or 3D position, without using any precise position labels during training. Prior CSI-based indoor positioning work has relied on non-parametric approaches using digital signal-processing (DSP) and, more recently, parametric approaches (e.g., fully supervised ML methods). However these do not handle the complexity of real-world environments well and do not meet requirements for large-scale commercial deployments: the accuracy of DSP-based method deteriorates significantly in non-line-of-sight conditions, while supervised ML methods need large amounts of hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. In contrast, WiClus-ter is precise, requires weaker label-information that can be easily collected, and works well in non-line-of-sight conditions. Our first contribution is a novel dimensionality reduction method for charting. It combines a triplet-loss with a multi-scale clustering-loss to map the high-dimensional CSI representation to a 2D/3D latent space. Our second contribution is two weakly supervised losses that map this latent space into a Cartesian map, resulting in meter-accuracy position results. These losses only require simple to acquire priors: a sketch of the floorplan, approximate access-point locations and a few CSI packets that are labeled with the corresponding zone in the floorplan. Thirdly, we report results and a robustness study for 2D positioning in two single-floor office buildings and 3D positioning in a two-story home.","","978-1-7281-8104-2","10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9685533","RF Sensing;802.11bf;WiFi;Channel State Information;Positioning;Self-supervised;Charting;Dimensionality Reduction","Training;Radio frequency;Dimensionality reduction;Three-dimensional displays;Transmitters;Receivers;Robustness","","","","","","24","IEEE","2 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider two different versions of DeepChannel; the first and second versions use LSTM and GRU as their basic cell structure, respectively. In contrast to prior work that is primarily focused on designing models for particular network settings, DeepChannel is highly adaptable and can predict future channel conditions for different networks, sampling rates, mobility patterns, and communication standards. We compare the performance (i.e., the root mean squared error, mean absolute error and relative error of future predictions) of DeepChannel with respect to two baselines-i) linear regression, and ii) ARIMA for multiple networks and communication standards. In particular, we consider 4G LTE, WiFi, WiMAX, an industrial network operating in the 5.8 GHz range, and Zigbee networks operating under varying levels of user mobility and observe that DeepChannel provides significantly superior performance.

This gridless scheme avoids the difficulty of the weight selection at the common boundary of the adjacent intervals that could meet in the grid-based method of FS-kNN, which needs to divide the RSSI space into the intervals, ahead. An outlier deleting procedure is further used to improve the accuracy of the localization system.

This CSI is sensed by smart IoT devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops for activity recognition. The use of differential CSI mitigates the offset and background noise. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it eliminates the requirement of traditional wearable activity recognition sensors, such as gyroscope, pedometers, and accelerometers. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model is used for automatic feature extraction and classification of human activities from the differential CSI. Training the LSTM model with the phase of differential denoised CSI significantly improves the classification accuracy.

In the literature, these energy-delay tradeoff issues have been addressed independently in the forms of Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) problems and network selection problems when smartphones have multiple wireless interfaces. In this paper, we jointly optimize the CPU speed and network speed to determine how much more energy can be saved through the joint optimization when applications can tolerate delays. We propose a dynamic speed scaling scheme called SpeedControl that jointly adjusts the processing and networking speeds using four controls: application scheduling, CPU speed control, wireless interface selection, and transmit power control. Through invoking the “Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty” technique, the scheme is demonstrated to be near optimal because it substantially reduces energy consumption for a given delay constraint. This paper is the first to reveal the energy-delay tradeoff relationship from a holistic perspective for smartphones with multiple wireless interfaces, DVFS, and multitasking capabilities. The trace-driven simulations based on real measurements of CPU power, network power, WiFi/3G throughput, and CPU workload demonstrate that SpeedControl can reduce battery usage by more than 42% through trading a 10 minutes delay when compared with the same delay in existing schemes; moreover, this energy conservation level increases as the WiFi coverage extends.","1558-2566","","10.1109/TNET.2015.2419219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7091048","CPU speed scaling;energy–delay tradeoff;heterogeneous wireless networks;multitasking;network interface selection;transmit power control","IEEE 802.11 Standards;Artificial neural networks;Delays;Network interfaces;Power demand;Power control;Wireless communication","energy conservation;power aware computing;smart phones","processor-network speed scaling;energy-delay tradeoff;smart phone applications;smart phone battery usage reduction;dynamic voltage and frequency scaling;DVFS problem;network selection problem;network speed;energy savings;SpeedControl scheme;application scheduling;CPU speed control;wireless interface selection;transmit power control;Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty technique;holistic perspective","","29","","41","IEEE","21 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

When WiFi radio receivers are employed as sensors for device-free human activity recognition, channel quality measurements are preprocessed in order to extract predictive features toward performing the desired activity recognition via machine learning (ML) models. Despite the variety of predictors in the literature, there is no universally outperforming set of features for all scenarios and applications. However, certain feature combinations could achieve a better average detection performance compared to the use of a thorough feature portfolio. Such predictors are often obtained by feature engineering and selection techniques applied before the learning process. This manuscript elaborates on the feature engineering and selection methodology for counting device-free people by solely resorting to the fluctuation and variation of WiFi signals exchanged by IoT devices. We comprehensively review the feature engineering and ML models employed in the literature from a critical perspective, identifying trends, research niches, and open challenges. Furthermore, we present and provide the community with a new open database with WiFi measurements in several indoor environments (i.e., rooms, corridors, and stairs) where up to five people can be detected.

In clinical practice, a treatment of the patients mainly relies on the differential diagnoses. While western medicine uses disease-based diagnosis, TCM emphasizes on patient-based diagnosis. In TCM, the patient's symptoms and signs are collected through four different methods: Inspection, Auscultation and Olfaction, Interrogation and Palpation. These symptoms and signs are interpreted into a diagnostic syndrome that often concludes a treatment for the patient. However, in the past, this process was normally done manually by TCM doctors and it was time consuming and tedious. There is a need to help TCM doctors to collect data easily and effectively. In this paper, we proposed a new mobile question system to collect the symptoms information from the patients before TCM doctors conduct clinical assessment. The system is lightweight, and it includes minicomputer (Raspberry Pi 4), tablets and Wi-Fi router. The prototype system was designed and implemented by collaborating with TCM doctors, and the current result was promising to be used in practice.

The main approaches widely used for indoor localization are based on the inertial measurement unit (IMU), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and ultra-wideband. The major problem with Bluetooth-based fingerprinting is the inconsistency of the radio signal strength, and the IMU-based localization has a drift error that increases with time. To compensate for these drawbacks, in the present study, a novel positioning system with IMU sensors and Bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon for a smartphone are introduced. The proposed trusted K nearest Bayesian estimation (TKBE) integrates BLE beacon and pedestrian dead reckoning positionings. The BLE-based positioning, using both the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and Bayesian estimation, increases the accuracy by 25% compared with the existing KNN-based positioning, and the proposed fuzzy logic-based Kalman filter increases the accuracy by an additional 15%.

However, its accuracy can be significantly reduced when most of the current recognition approaches are applied to new users who have not participated in model training. To address this issue, a new passive human activity recognition method based on CSI is proposed in this work. A cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) is used to map old user CSI activity data to new user CSI activity data. Multiple dense blocks from a dense convolutional network (DenseNet) and a large margin cosine (margin) module are then combined to automatically extract features with representative differences in different activities to identify multiple human activities. According to the results of the model on SignFi data and self-collected data on the eight daily activities of ten volunteers, the activity recognition accuracy of new users is found to reach 95.63% and 96.67%, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better performance than the benchmark approaches.","","978-1-6654-1236-0","10.1109/SWC50871.2021.00019","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9604411","WiFi;Channel State Information;Human activity recognition;CycleGAN;CosFace","Training;Technological innovation;Training data;Activity recognition;Benchmark testing;Generative adversarial networks;Feature extraction","convolutional neural nets;feature extraction;image recognition","dense margin network;augmented channel state information;privacy protection;current recognition approaches;passive human activity recognition method;cycle-consistent generative adversarial network;multiple dense blocks;dense convolutional network;margin cosine module;multiple human activities;self-collected data;activity recognition accuracy","","","","28","IEEE","18 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based on the general semi-supervised GANs, we mainly design three components for CsiGAN to meet the scenarios that unlabeled data from left-out users are very limited and enhance recognition performance: 1) we introduce a new complement generator, which can use limited unlabeled data to produce diverse fake samples for training a robust discriminator; 2) for the discriminator, we change the number of probability outputs from k + 1 into 2k + 1 (here, k is the number of categories), which can help to obtain the correct decision boundary for each category; and 3) based on the introduced generator, we propose a manifold regularization, which can stabilize the learning process.

In this article, we formulate the problem of recognizing authorized transmitters and rejecting new transmitters as open set recognition and anomaly detection. We consider approaches based on one and several binary classifiers, multiclass classifiers, and signal reconstruction. We study how these approaches scale with the required number of authorized transmitters. We propose using a known set of unauthorized transmitters to assist the training and study its impact. The evaluation procedure takes into consideration that some transmitters might be more similar than others and nuances these effects. The authorization's robustness against temporal changes in fingerprints is also evaluated as a function of the approach and the dataset structure.

According to the offline simulation, the complexity of cluster k-NN is lower, while the accuracy is up to 98.67%. As a result, the complexity and the calculation are greatly decreased, while the accuracy is still maintained. We have also made the application including our algorithm and data on Android based smart phones with intuitive user interface and quick access to change parameters, in order to briefly demonstrate our result to determine the location of users in real time. Online positioning was tested under cluster k-NN with the optimal parameters obtained through offline simulation.

However, to reap the benefits of LTE-LAA, a fair coexistence mechanism with other incumbent WiFi deployments is required. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach is proposed for modeling the resource allocation problem of LTE-LAA small base stations (SBSs). The proposed approach enables multiple SBSs to proactively perform dynamic channel selection, carrier aggregation, and fractional spectrum access while guaranteeing fairness with existing WiFi networks and other LTE-LAA operators. Adopting a proactive coexistence mechanism enables future delay-tolerant LTE-LAA data demands to be served within a given prediction window ahead of their actual arrival time thus avoiding the underutilization of the unlicensed spectrum during off-peak hours while maximizing the total served LTE-LAA traffic load. To this end, a noncooperative game model is formulated in which SBSs are modeled as homo egualis agents that aim at predicting a sequence of future actions and thus achieving long-term equal weighted fairness with wireless local area network and other LTE-LAA operators over a given time horizon. The proposed deep learning algorithm is then shown to reach a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, when it converges. Simulation results using real data traces show that the proposed scheme can yield up to 28% and 11% gains over a conventional reactive approach and a proportional fair coexistence mechanism, respectively. The results also show that the proposed framework prevents WiFi performance degradation for a densely deployed LTE-LAA network.","1558-2248","","10.1109/TWC.2018.2829773","University Of Edinburgh; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:IIS-1633363,CNS-1460316,AST-1460333); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8359094","Licensed assisted access LTE (LTE-LAA);LTE-U;small cell;unlicensed band;long short term memory (LSTM);deep reinforcement learning;game theory;proactive resource allocation","Resource management;Long Term Evolution;Wireless fidelity;Wireless communication;Machine learning;Games","cellular radio;channel allocation;cognitive radio;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;radio spectrum management;resource allocation;wireless LAN","proactive resource management;unlicensed spectrum;deep learning perspective;licensed assisted access LTE;wireless spectrum scarcity;LTE-LAA operators;proactive coexistence mechanism;total served LTE-LAA traffic load;long-term equal weighted fairness;proportional fair coexistence mechanism;densely deployed LTE-LAA network;cellular long term evolution communications;fractional spectrum access;delay-tolerant LTE-LAA data;mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium;noncooperative game model;homo egualis agents;prediction window;arrival time","","84","","48","IEEE","15 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Fast and Accurate Streaming CNN Inference via Communication Compression on the Edge","D. Hu; B.

While the small model size reduces the storage overhead and the light-weight layer operations alleviate the burden of the edge processors, it is still challenging to sustain high inference performance due to limited and varying inter-device bandwidth. We propose a streaming inference framework to simultaneously improve throughput and accuracy by communication compression. Specifically, we perform the following optimizations: 1) Partition: we split the CNN layers such that the devices achieve computation load-balance; 2) Compression: we identify inter-device communication bottlenecks and insert Auto-Encoders into the original CNN to compress data traffic; 3) Scheduling: we adaptively select the compression ratio when the variation of bandwidth is large. The above optimizations improve inference throughput significantly due to better communication performance. More importantly, accuracy also increases since 1) fewer frames are dropped when input images are streamed in at a high rate, and 2) the frames successfully entering the pipeline are processed accurately since the AE-based compression incurs negligible information loss. We evaluate MobileNet-v2 on pipeline of Raspberry Pi 3B+. Our compression techniques lead to up to 32% accuracy improvement, when average Wi-Fi bandwidth varies from 3 to 9Mbps.","","978-1-7281-6602-5","10.1109/IoTDI49375.2020.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9097616","Edge computing, CNN, Data Compression","Bandwidth;Throughput;Pipelines;Computational modeling;Image coding;Image edge detection;Convolution","computer vision;convolutional neural nets;data compression;optimisation;resource allocation;telecommunication traffic","communication compression;CNN layers;computation load-balance;inter-device communication bottlenecks;auto-encoders;compression ratio;communication performance;compression techniques;average Wi-Fi bandwidth;compact CNN models;computer vision;storage overhead reduction;edge processors;high inference performance;inter-device bandwidth;streaming inference framework;lightweight layer operations;data traffic compression;scheduling;input image streaming;information loss;AE-based compression;MobileNet-v2;Raspberry Pi 3B+","","13","","22","","21 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Wi-Fi standards require nodes to adopt a fixed value for the minimum contention window (CWmin), which prohibits a node from reacting to aggressive nodes that set their CWmin to small values. To address this problem, we propose a framework called Intelligent-CW (ICW) that allows nodes to adapt their CWmin values based on observed transmissions, ensuring they receive their fair share of the channel airtime. The CWmin value at a node is set based on a random forest, a machine learning model that includes a large number of decision trees. We train the random forest in a supervised manner over a large number of WLAN scenarios, including different misbehaving and aggressive scenarios. Under aggressive scenarios, our simulation results reveal that ICW provides nodes with higher throughput (153.9% gain) and 64% lower frame latency than standard techniques. In order to measure the fairness contribution of individual nodes, we introduce a new fairness metric. Based on this metric, ICW is shown to provide 10.89× improvement in fairness in aggressive scenarios compared to standard techniques.","2334-3125","978-1-7281-2376-9","10.1109/DySPAN.2019.8935851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8935851","","Decision trees;Throughput;Standards;Random forests;Vegetation;Dynamic spectrum access;Wireless fidelity","5G mobile communication;Long Term Evolution;random forests;wireless channels;wireless LAN","metric ICW;fairness metric;individual nodes;aggressive scenarios;WLAN scenarios;machine learning model;random forest;channel airtime;fair share;observed transmissions;CWmin value;aggressive nodes;minimum contention window;Wi-Fi standards;channel access;intelligent techniques;AI-based framework;Intelligent-CW;frequency 5.0 GHz","","6","","20","","19 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Specifically, CellinDeep captures the non-linear relation between the cellular signal heard by a mobile phone and its location. To do that, it leverages a deep network to model the inherent dependency between the signals of the different cell towers in the area of interest, allowing it achieve high localization accuracy. As part of the design of CellinDeep, we introduce modules to address a number of practical challenges such as handling the noise in the input wireless signal, reducing the amount of data required for the deep learning model, as avoiding over-training.

Therefore, there is a need to make WiFi network more reliable, effective, and manageable. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are making way to utilize large volumes of data generated to monitor and manage large wireless networks. In this paper, we propose data driven sensing and analysis framework for making WiFi networks efficiently manageable. Our proposed framework referred as WiNetSense can be used to monitor and analyze the network features that are affecting the wireless links and also the network. We also propose a novel mobility estimation method using WiNetSense, which requires as minimum as two Access Points (APs) only to estimate the WiFi station's (STA) position and mobility.

To effectively perform detection and identification, feature engineering is carried out to describe the signature of different micro-UAV signals. The approach for feature engineering is based on the division of raw continuous sampled signals into several valid frames in time domain. In each frame, cyclostationarity features as well as kurtosis and spectrum factors are extracted after signal preprocessing. Selected features of UAV signals and ambient noise are fed to support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) models to obtain a well-trained classifier. Then the classifier is used to detect and identify non-cooperative micro-UAVs. In the detection phase, all detected UAV signals from ambient noise, specifically WiFi signal in this paper, are treated as invading non-cooperative micro-UAVs where the detection scenario is assumed as a no-fly-zone. In the identification phase, the type of micro-UAV is identified based on its downlink communication protocol from the detected UAV signals. In this paper, two kinds of micro-UAV signals and ambient WiFi signal as background interference are tested versus various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method proves to be feasible to detect micro-UAVs and identify the protocol UAV used in downlink communication. More different types of micro-UAV signals will be sampled into database for the future work.","","978-1-7281-5256-1","10.1109/ICSAI48974.2019.9010185","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9010185","Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) Detection;Radio Frequency Signal;Cyclostationarity Signature;Signal Classification","OFDM;Downlink;Wireless fidelity;Feature extraction;RF signals;Delays;Correlation","aircraft communication;autonomous aerial vehicles;feature extraction;protocols;radiofrequency interference;signal classification;signal detection;signal sampling;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;wireless LAN","microUAV signals;raw continuous sampled signals;signal preprocessing;ambient noise;ambient WiFi signal;signal-to-noise ratio levels;microUAV detection;radio frequency signature;microunmanned aerial vehicles;UAV downlink communication;no-fly-zone;support vector machine;SVM;k-nearest neighbor models;KNN models;downlink communication protocol;background interference;SNR levels;RF signature;cyclostationarity features;noncooperative microUAV","","5","","17","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have also incorporated Wi-Fi and GSM modules in our device to make it viable for telemonitoring. To monitor all these physical parameters, we have also introduced a custom-made android application. These would allow the expecting mothers to assess their health conditions.

In this paper, we exploit a Deep Learning (DL)-based identification strategy for Radio Frequency (RF) Fingerprints. Specifically, we introduce an Echo State Network (ESN), uniquely suited for nonlinear information processing, to discover dissimilar RF Fingerprints directly from raw transmitted signals, allowing the network to discriminate radio devices. Through an over-the-air WiFi transmission dataset, numerical evaluations demonstrate advantages of the ESN over the cutting-edge DL-based identification approaches, yielding an average classification accuracy of 98.11% while significantly reducing the training overhead.

In particular, we demonstrate how to isolate anomalous RF patterns by applying time series modeling and analysis of downlink multi-cell radio signals. These RF anomalies may indicate a situation change, namely, a body or object(s), movement in the surrounding of the smart-phone. Unlike Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices, that can be turned on and off according to the user demands, cellular radios are never really disconnected. Even in idle mode, they carry out continuous and autonomous measurements of the radio channel conditions, namely, the cellular signal quality (CSQ). This is performed in agreement with standardized cell reselection procedures. Body movements or scene changes in general in the surroundings of a cellular device are responsible for small CSQ fluctuations that can be isolated from normal network operations and classified accordingly. The validation of this unconventional RF sensing method is based on extensive measurement campaigns covering a period of one month, using up to four commercial off-the-shelf smartphones. As a practical application case study, we developed a real-time demonstrator that is able to detect body proximity events close to the device and discriminate other body-induced environmental changes in the surrounding of the smartphone.

However, due to severe challenges about signal variation, device heterogeneity, and database degradation root in environmental dynamics, pioneer works usually make a trade-off among them. In this paper, we propose iToLoc, a deep learning based localization system that achieves all three goals simultaneously.

In this article, we propose a long-term effective, robust, and accurate device-free passive fingerprinting localization scheme LTLoc, which only requires a single communication link. It takes the amplitudes extracted from the CSI along with the calibrated phases as fingerprints and trains a deep neural network (DNN) regression model to estimate the target location. Since Wi-Fi signals are susceptible to various environmental factors, CSI fingerprints also change over time, making the performance of the localization model built with the fingerprint database drop dramatically over a long period, and recalibrating the entire positioning area is laborious and time-consuming. To address this problem, we design an adaptive DNN (AdaptDNN) based on meta-networks by combining deep learning and domain adaptive methods. It can use meta-network learning to determine which layers and features of the DNN need to be transferred to automatically adapt to CSI fingerprints change. Extensive evaluations in an indoor environment with significantly different CSI fingerprints over six days have shown that LTLoc’s effectiveness in coping with changing CSI fingerprints over a long period is significantly superior to existing work in terms of localization and adaptability.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3098019","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(grant numbers:61673310); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9490297","Channel state information (CSI);deep neural network (DNN);domain adaptation (DA);indoor device-free passive localization","Fingerprint recognition;Location awareness;Training;Adaptation models;Deep learning;Wireless fidelity;Performance evaluation","","","","","","44","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Concrete may lose its strength due to continuous loading and environmental impacts. As a result, damage (crack and spall) may occur on the exterior surface of the structure. Whenever these deformities are left unexplored and untreated, the integrity of the structure may be compromised. Therefore, regular maintenance of the structure is needed. Some previous vision-based studies have used a drone as a vehicle to capture and record the current state of the structure. Later, captured videos and images were analyzed to determine damage using object classification, localization, and segmentation methods. Also, in a few studies, drones relay the collected data to the server using a wireless medium. However, the developed systems are very complex, time-intensive, and require high bandwidth. To address these problems, this paper uses the edge computing principle to propose a real-time multi-drone damage detection system using one of the advance deep learning models called You Look Only Once-version3 (YOLO-v3) for high-rise civil structures. The proposed system uses Jetson-TX2 as a hardware platform to run YOLO-v3 and is deployed on Pixhawk’s hardware standards-based open source hexacopter drone. During a coordinated survey, if the damage is observed, the Jetson-TX2 on-board, after processing, sends only the damage-related information to the server that resides on the ground through the Wi-Fi channel. Our proposed system is evaluated on a dataset containing 800 (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$480\times480$ </tex-math></inline-formula> pixels) images of different types of damage, collected from multiple structures of CSIR-CEERI, Pilani.

We firstly expose that simple edge detection algorithms based on morphological processing, which are conventionally used to detect signals in spectrogram matrices, do not provide a scalable performance beyond a few RF captures because they suffer from limited hyperparameter generalizability. To overcome this limitation, we propose a support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm, wherein, we run a sliding detection window across the spectrogram and extract the histogram of ordered gradient (HOG) features. The extracted feature vectors are used to classify the windows as positive or negative, depending on whether a signal of interest is present or not. For experimental evaluation, we generate a synthetic RF dataset containing 150 training captures and 50 test captures, each of duration 90ms, bandwidth 56MHz, and containing about 4.5 Wi-Fi signals on average.

Unfortunately, it is difficult to filter out the behavior information from the collected RF signals.In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving deep neural network named BPCloak to erase the behavior information in RF signals while retaining the ability of user authentication. We conduct extensive experiments over mainstream RF signals collected from three real wireless systems, including the WiFi, Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), and millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. The experimental results show that BPCloak significantly reduces the behavior recognition accuracy, i.e., 85%+, 75%+, and 65%+ reduction for WiFi, RFID, and mmWave systems respectively, merely with a slight penalty of accuracy decrease when using these three systems for user authentication, i.e., 1%-, 3%-, and 5%-, respectively.","1548-615X","978-1-6654-1494-4","10.1109/IWQOS52092.2021.9521278","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Research and Development; Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521278","","Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Privacy;Wireless sensor networks;RF signals;Authentication;Information filters","data privacy;deep learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;millimetre waves;mobile computing;radiofrequency identification","behavior information;RF signals;wireless systems;millimeter-wave systems;BPCloak;behavior recognition;RF sensing;signal distortion;wireless transmission;privacy-preserving deep neural network;RF based identity authentication;RF based user authentication;WiFi;radio frequency identification;mobile devices","","","","38","","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering that no single technology can currently solve the problem of continuous worker monitoring, the article targets the development of an IoT multisensor data fusion (MDF) platform. It is based on an edge-cloud architecture that supports the combination and transformation of multiple sensing technologies to enable the passive and anonymous detection of workers. Multidimensional data acquisition from different IoT sources, signal preprocessing, feature extraction, data distribution, and fusion, along with machine learning (ML) and computing methods are described. The proposed IoT platform also comprises a practical solution for data fusion and analytics. It is able to perform opportunistic and real-time perception of workers by fusing and analyzing radio signals obtained from several interconnected IoT components, namely, a multiantenna WiFi installation (2.4-5 GHz), a sub-THz imaging camera (100 GHz), a network of radars (122 GHz) and infrared sensors (8-13 μm).

Regarding the issue above, this paper proposes a novel physical layer authentication method for Internet of Things based on differential contour stellar. Through the test of identification and authentication of 20 WiFi network card devices from same manufacturer, same type and same batch, the recognition accuracy rate can reach 98.6% by the proposed method. The proposed method can improve the effect of radio frequency fingerprint identification from three aspects: i. The differential processing can effectively reduce the negative influence of phase rotation caused by carrier frequency offset and Doppler effects; ii.

As mobility is a key element of many processes and activities, an interesting class of information to extract is movement patterns that quantify how humans move, interact and group. In this paper we propose methods for detecting two common pedestrian movement patterns, namely individual following relations and group leadership. The proposed methods for identifying following patterns employ machine learning on features derived using similarity analysis on time lagged sequences of WiFi measurements containing either raw signal strength values or derived locations. To detect leadership we combine the individual following relations into directed graphs and detect leadership within groups by graph link analysis. Methods for detecting these movement patterns open up new possibilities in — amongst others — computational social science, reality mining, marketing research and location-based gaming. We provide evaluation results that show error rates down to 7%, improving over state of the art methods with up to eleven percentage points for following patterns and up to twenty percentage points for leadership patterns. Our method is, contrary to state of the art, also applicable in challenging indoor environments, e.g., multi-story buildings. This implies that even quite small samples allow us to detect information such as how events and campaigns in multistory shopping malls may trigger following in small groups, or which group members typically take the lead when triggered by e.g. commercials, or how rescue or police forces act during training exercises.","","978-1-4673-4575-0","10.1109/PerCom.2013.6526714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6526714","pattern recognition;crowd behavior sensing;mobile sensing;signal strength-based methods","Lead;Vectors;Feature extraction;Time measurement;Sensors;IEEE 802.11 Standards","directed graphs;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;pedestrians;traffic engineering computing","location-based gaming;marketing research;reality mining;computational social science;graph link analysis;directed graph;Wireless Fidelity;WiFi measurement;similarity analysis;machine learning;pedestrian movement pattern;information extraction;location sensor;movement sensor;mobile sensing data;pedestrian leadership behavior;pedestrian following behavior","","22","","23","","10 Jun 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the increasingly dynamic mobile environments make it harderto always apply cryptographic-based methods for user authentication due to their infrastructural and key management overhead. Exploiting non-cryptographic based techniques grounded on physical layer properties to perform user authentication appears promising. In this work, the use of channel state information (CSI), which is available from off-the-shelf WiFi devices, to perform fine-grained user authentication is explored. Particularly, a user-authentication framework that can work with both stationary and mobile users is proposed. When the user is stationary, the proposed framework builds a user profile for user authentication that is resilient to the presence of a spoofer. The proposed machine learning based user-authentication techniques can distinguish between two users even when they possess similar signal fingerprints and detect the existence of a spoofer. When the user is mobile, it is proposed to detect the presence of a spoofer by examining the temporal correlation of CSI measurements. Both office building and apartment environments show that the proposed framework can filter out signal outliers and achieve higher authentication accuracy compared with existing approaches using received signal strength (RSS).","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2017.2718540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7955011","User authentication;channel state information;wireless networks","Authentication;Wireless communication;Mobile communication;Cryptography;Mobile computing;Correlation;Communication system security","cryptography;data privacy;learning (artificial intelligence);message authentication;telecommunication security;wireless channels;wireless LAN","fine-grained user authentication;user-authentication framework;stationary users;mobile users;user profile;higher authentication accuracy;fine-grained channel information;RSS;received signal strength;CSI measurements;temporal correlation;machine learning;off-the-shelf WiFi devices;channel state information;physical layer properties;infrastructural management overhead;key management overhead;cryptographic-based methods;dynamic mobile environments;identity-based attack detection;noncryptographic based techniques;malicious attacks","","31","","34","IEEE","22 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, a number of features are extracted from the data acquired by smartphone sensors, such as the user's location from GPS coordinates and visible wi-fi access points, and the physical activity from accelerometer data. Second, several classifiers trained by machine learning are used to recognise the user's activity, such as work, exercise or eating.

In this paper, we address the problem of TCP throughput prediction for opportunistic networks. Applications of opportunistic networking can benefit from such predictions by adapting to prevailing network conditions. Our approach is different from prior efforts to model wireless network throughput in that only the two communicating endpoints participate in the prediction, and no information about network topology or traffic loads generated by interfering sources is required. Our goal is to understand how accurate throughput predictions can be under the above assumptions. The physical environment considered in our study includes varying degrees of interference, indoor and outdoor networks, and nodes that are stationary or moving at walking or driving speeds. We use throughput predictors based on time series analysis and machine learning techniques, as they are well-suited to predicting phenomena with unknown variables. The prediction accuracy that our methods yield is cause for cautious optimism. We find that 80% to 100% of predictions are within a factor of two of actual throughput. This bound on accuracy means that predictions are useful for certain applications, because this bound (a) can be achieved by measurements lasting for as little as 0.3 seconds, and (b) holds even when nodes are driving at speeds of 15-25 mph.","2155-5494","978-1-4244-2907-3","10.1109/SAHCN.2009.5168952","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5168952","","Throughput;Wireless networks;Accuracy;Urban areas;IP networks;Predictive models;Network topology;Telecommunication traffic;Interference;Legged locomotion","learning (artificial intelligence);time series;transport protocols;wireless LAN","TCP throughput prediction;opportunistic wireless network;WiFi access point;time series analysis;machine learning","","8","","31","","21 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The offline service provides a fine-grained sleep log like timing and regularity of bed time, onset of sleep and night time awakenings. The online service keeps guarding the subject for any abnormal behaviors during sleep like intensive body twitches and a sudden seizure attack.

However, such a crowd-based approach also introduces an accuracy degradation problem as crowd customers are not professional trained and equipped. So in this approach we employ fixed and hint landmarks to do error resetting. In our practical system, common corridor crossing points will serve as fixed landmarks and cross points between different crowd paths serve as hint landmarks. Machine-learning techniques are utilized for short range approximation around fixed landmarks and fuzzy logic decision technology is applied for searching hint landmarks in crowd traces space. We test this crowd-based automatic collecting approach on a dataset of about 5.09km walking in four corridors and the rooms besides.

Landmark and WiFi based systems rely on up-to-date reference points and radio maps. These are expensive to refresh for most current systems because of the exhaustive site surveys these rely on. Any physical change in the environment may cause unpredictable transformation in the radio propagation medium or it may affect the typical navigation paths inside the building. Active Learning (AL) involves human intervention in annotating sensor samples collected from the target environment. However, the burden on users to perform this manual task should be minimized to make the approach more user-friendly. We propose a solution that improves AL by involving the users only when sensor data deviates from what is expected at a location. Our solution analyses the confidence of location estimations in the environment. We propose a robust data distribution shift detector that looks at several levels in our location estimation neural network to determine the confidence of predictions. During the training stage, the model builds high confidence for estimations in the areas where data is available. We show that data from outside the training distribution is detected as anomaly, which triggers the AL to prompt the user for her current location as label. These annotated samples and other augmented data are then used to update the location estimation model.","2471-917X","978-1-6654-0402-0","10.1109/IPIN51156.2021.9662543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9662543","indoor localization;active learning;data distribution shift;estimation confidence","Training;Location awareness;Neural networks;Estimation;Detectors;Radio propagation;Data models","","","","","","29","","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, to the best of our knowledge, the accuracy of such measurements has never been rigorously assessed. The goals of this article are to assess the accuracy of the RSSI measurements made with a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) smartphone in a variety of conditions and how possible inaccuracies can be corrected. We primarily focus on the long-term evolution (LTE) RSSI, but we also extend our results to the Bluetooth RSSI. In this article, we build a controlled experimental setup based on commodity hardware and on open-source software. We evaluate the granularity and limitations of the Android application programming interface (API) that returns the RSSI. We explore how reliable the measurements in a controlled environment with a mono-polarized antenna are. We show that the orientation of the smartphone, the position or orientation of the source, and the transmission power have a significant impact on the accuracy of the measurements. We introduce several correction techniques based on radiation matrix manipulations and on machine learning in order to improve measurement accuracy to less than 5-dBm RMSE, when compared to a professional equipment. We also explore the reliability of measurements made in an outdoor realistic environment.

To deploy such services in our ambient environment, it is expected to fully utilize battery-less and maintenance-free IoT devices and technologies for more ambient, distributed computing. In recent years, Wi-Fi-based communications are becoming more energy-efficient, and channel state information (CSI) has the potential to sense more detailed information about the things in the real world. Besides, ambient backscatter has appeared as a promising technology for zero-energy sensing and communications. Leveraging those state-of-the-art technologies, energy harvested IoT devices for context recognition of humans and objects will be in reality. A significant challenge is how to make use of inferior, less-powerful zero-energy IoT devices to achieve processing of interest, i.e., accurate recognition of humans and objects, while a single device does not work. Therefore, we consider orchestrating distributed tiny IoT devices for both sensing and communications. Particularly, distributed machine learning in the local environment will achieve highly promising sensing in our ambient environment. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art technologies for zero-energy sensing and communications in the context of humans and objects sensing and recognition. Then, we address the challenges to be tackled in terms of such distributed, intelligent sensing using zero-energy devices.

PDR can provide location information relative to the original position by analyzing acceleration and angular velocity using sensors in smartphones without needing any positioning equipment in the environment. Meanwhile, to know the user's context in the indoor environment, PDR, RFID and surveillance cameras are investigated. Although PDR results can provide the atomic physical behavior such as the direction of walking (forward/backward or right/left), it is difficult to detect the user's shopping behaviors to determine if he/she is approaching, searching or just browsing in the shopping venues. Our research objective is to estimate the user's walking context appropriate for shopping venues with the same sensor information as used for conventional PDR.

However, we need to acquire a dataset with a high-density dataset in the target environment in this framework. To overcome the data acquisition cost problem, we propose a brand new data augmentation for Wi-Fi indoor localization named Between-Location data augmentation (BL data augmentation). We generate the fingerprint data for the whole target environment with high density by only using the sparsely sampled data. Between-Class learning, which is the origin of BL data augmentation and the latest powerful data augmentation method for sound recognition and image processing, mixes two data linearly with normalization; however, this mixing does not make sense in indoor localization because mixed fingerprint has no meaning and the label of indoor localization is not categorical information but physically correlated information. To overcome these two problems, we propose the generative model based on neural networks installed the physical relationship of labels and Wi-Fi fingerprint property. BL data augmentation enables us to reduce data sampled locations while keeping the localization accuracy even if some target locations have no data. From the experimental results, indoor localization methods with BL data augmentation outperform the state-of-the-art data augmentation method on several indoor localization models, whatever the data collection location is dense or sparse. Moreover, the localization with BL data augmentation using 10 % sampled location achieves the same accuracy with localization without data augmentation using all sampled locations.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3106765","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9524448","Data augmentation;fingerprinting;indoor positioning;RSSI modeling;virtual sensing","Location awareness;Data models;Wireless fidelity;Data acquisition;Image processing;Image recognition;Sensors","","","","","","34","IEEE","27 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, edge servers are not always safe. For instance, there are researches show that 89% of WiFi hotspots are unsecured. Hence, it is possible for attackers to know where you go at a given time of the day, which places you prefer to visit from images collected by IoT devices, such as camera, UAVs.

With the rising of Internet of Things (IoT), heterogeneous smartphones and wearables have become ubiquitous. However, the ILBSs for heterogeneous IoT devices confront significant challenges, such as received signal strength (RSS) variances caused by hardware heterogeneity, multipath reflections from complex environments, and localization time restricted by computation resources. This article proposes EdgeLoc, a robust and real-time indoor localization system toward heterogeneous IoT devices to solve the above challenges. In particular, the RSS fingerprinting data of Wi-Fi is employed for localization and tackling the heterogeneity of IoT devices in twofold. First, feature-level and signal-level solutions are presented to address the random RSS variances. At the feature level, this work proposes a novel capsule neural network model to efficiently extract incremental features from RSS fingerprinting data. At the signal level, a multistep dataflow is further devised to process RSS fingerprints into image-like data, which utilizes the feature matrix to reduce absolute sensing errors introduced by hardware heterogeneity. Second, an edge-IoT framework is designed to utilize the edge server to train the deep learning model and further supports real-time localization for heterogeneous IoT devices. Extensive field experiments with over 33 600 data points are conducted to validate the effectiveness of EdgeLoc with a large-scale Wi-Fi fingerprint data set. The results show that EdgeLoc outperforms the state-of-the-art SAE-CNN method in localization accuracy by up to 14.4%, with an average error of 0.68 m and an average positioning time of 2.05 ms.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3101368","National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Project(grant numbers:41174158,61902211); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9502156","Capsule neural network (CapsNet);deep learning;edge computing;indoor localization;Internet of Things (IoT)","Location awareness;Wireless fidelity;Real-time systems;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Internet of Things;Data models","","","","","","43","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To fairly access the shared bandwidth, wireless users will necessarily need to quickly sense large portions of spectrum and opportunistically access unutilized bands. The key unaddressed challenges of spectrum sensing are that (i) it has to be performed with extremely low latency over large bandwidths to detect tiny spectrum holes and to guarantee strict real-time digital signal processing (DSP) constraints; (ii) its underlying algorithms need to be extremely accurate, and flexible enough to work with different wireless bands and protocols to find application in real-world settings. To the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks spectrum sensing techniques able to accomplish both requirements. In this paper, we propose DeepSense, a software/hardware framework for real-time wideband spectrum sensing that relies on real-time deep learning tightly integrated into the transceiver's baseband processing logic to detect and exploit unutilized spectrum bands. DeepSense uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in the wireless platform's hardware fabric to analyze a small portion of the unprocessed baseband waveform to automatically extract the maximum amount of information with the least amount of I/Q samples. We extensively validate the accuracy, latency and generality performance of DeepSense with (i) a 400 GB dataset containing hundreds of thousands of WiFi transmissions collected ""in the wild"" with different Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) conditions and over different days; (ii) a dataset of transmissions collected using our own software-defined radio testbed; and (iii) a synthetic dataset of LTE transmissions under controlled SNR conditions. We also measure the real-time latency of the CNNs trained on the three datasets with an FPGA implementation, and compare our approach with a fixed energy threshold mechanism. Results show that our learning-based approach can deliver a precision and recall of 98% and 97% respectively and a latency as low as 0.61ms.

Network edge servers, or base stations (BS), use edge computing to make time-critical decisions, especially in IoT devices while the data are being transmitted into the cloud. As the dynamic spectrum sharing continues in B5G, BSs implements the coexistence between Wi-Fi and cellular network. These exciting advances require energy efficiency to be considered as network operators pay the majority of the expenses to energy consumption. In this paper, different prediction models on traffic behaviour are computed to determine the lowest root mean square error. The best prediction model is used in the wake-up policy to consider the communication and computing times of the BS needed to return in service. Furthermore, a wake-up policy for the BS is introduced to maintain Quality of Service (QoS) while minimizing energy consumption. Particularly, a wake-up time threshold is set so that if the duration of the traffic prediction time does not cross this threshold, the decision will not be in favour to put it into sleep mode. This ensures that the QoS of the user is not compromised, as this threshold removes the unnecessary wasted time for BS to go to sleep and wake-up.","2576-7046","978-1-6654-4864-2","10.1109/CCECE53047.2021.9569058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9569058","BSG;Machine Learning;Coexistence;IoT","Cellular networks;Energy consumption;Computational modeling;Standards organizations;Quality of service;Predictive models;Time factors","5G mobile communication;6G mobile communication;cellular radio;cloud computing;energy consumption;mean square error methods;mobile computing;quality of service;radio spectrum management;telecommunication power management;telecommunication traffic","edge computing;time-critical decisions;dynamic spectrum sharing;energy efficiency;network operators;energy consumption;lowest root mean square error;prediction model;wake-up policy;wake-up time threshold;traffic prediction time;B5G;intelligent coexistence model;edge network;fifth-generation cellular network;5G;standard bodies;edge intelligence;artificial intelligence;network edge servers;base stations;quality of service;QoS","","","","16","IEEE","26 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the offline phase, RSS values of all Wi-Fi signals detected from the available access points are collected at different reference points with known locations and are stored in a database. In the online phase, the target position is estimated by calculating fuzzy membership functions of samples and using formulation of fuzzy LS-SVM method.

By using Wi-Fi, it is possible to determine the position of people or assets with good accuracy. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the most popular deterministic location fingerprinting algorithms generally used for WLAN-based indoor positioning. As KNN takes only the K nearest neighbors for estimating a position, in some cases it may not obtain satisfied accuracy because of the indoor environment factors such as reflections, diffraction, and scattering of the radio waves. In this paper, we propose a novel method named Predicted K Nearest Neighbors (PKNN) which estimates the current position of a mobile user not only by using K found neighbors but also by utilizing its previous positions and speed. With experiments, we found that PKNN does outperform KNN by 33% or at mean 1.3 meter improvement in error.","","978-1-56555-341-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5589221","Positioning;Fingerprint;KNN;RSS;WLAN","Fingerprint recognition;Wireless LAN;Nearest neighbor searches;Mobile communication;Prediction algorithms;Accuracy;Filtering","fingerprint identification;mobile communication;ubiquitous computing;wireless LAN","RSS-based fingerprinting method;positioning;historical data;indoor WLAN environment;ubiquitous computing;Wi-Fi;K nearest neighbors","","5","","25","","7 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The indoor positioning is typically fulfilled through radio signal strength indicators (RSSIs) of referred devices with specific media such as Wi-Fi access points (APs) and Wi-Fi station devices (STAs). So, the capability of typical positioning schemes is highly close to the signal acquisition environments of such media. In other words, since STAs frequently fall into a sleep mode to save the battery power and some data acquisition technologies are based on advertising intervals, the amount of RSSIs of referring devices could not be gathered enough to detect correct positions of individuals. In this paper, a novel individual positioning mechanism, called PIPing (Proxy Individual Positioning), is come up with. The PIPing mechanism carries out proxy signal acquisition via IEEE 802.11 monitor mode devices to overcome such restrictions. In addition, PIPing includes machine learning based signal data analytics to provide high reliable results for positioning. Based on the proof-of-concept prototype, PIPing can acquire much higher amount of RSSI data than existing manners, about 330% increment; the reliability of positioning for a home with seven rooms shows 96.4% via the support vector machine (SVM) and 96.5% by the multilayer perceptron (MLP) with autoencoder denoising to tune up signals.","2577-2465","978-1-7281-1220-6","10.1109/VTCFall.2019.8891177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8891177","","Monitoring;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Support vector machines;Wireless fidelity;Mobile handsets;Servers;Probes","data acquisition;indoor navigation;indoor radio;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons;RSSI;signal denoising;signal detection;support vector machines;telecommunication network reliability;telecommunication power management;wireless LAN","data acquisition technologies;Proxy Individual Positioning;PIPing mechanism;proxy signal acquisition;IEEE 802.11 monitor mode devices;signal data analytics;indoor positioning;smart home applications;radio signal strength indicators;Wi-Fi access points;signal acquisition;individual positioning mechanism;RSSI;support vector machine;SVM;multilayer perceptron;MLP;autoencoder denoising","","1","","14","","7 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paradigm shift in the usage patterns of the Internet, along with the urgent needs for content naming, pervasive caching, better security, and mobility support, has prompted researchers to consider a radical change to the Internet architecture. However, ICN is still in its infancy and development stage, and many issues still exist and need to be addressed. The common ICN architecture is lacking the host-centric communication ability and difficult to provide seamless mobility in current solutions. To solve this problem, our team had proposed the Named-Node Networking (3N) concept, which not only naming the content but also naming the node and it proved to have better performance of providing seamless mobility in the simulation. However, the previous contributions were limited in the 3N namespace for seamless mobility support in both producer and consumer.

Due to the uncertainties originated from the integration of the IoT technology and power electronic converters, the deterministic methodologies are unable to precisely model the SG anymore. In response to these challenges, this article addresses a novel adaptive data-driven method based on the active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) for the voltage regulation of an IoT-based dc-dc buck converter feeding constant power loads. In particular, a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) with the actor-critic architecture is adopted for the online adjusting of the ADRC controller. The established DDPG takes into account the ADRC controller coefficients into the design objective and offers the ADRC controller with the online coefficient setting ability through the neural network learning. The IoT-based system is tested on a real-time testbed with the constrained application protocol protocol and IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) network to assess the applicability of the suggested controller in the presence of network degradations. The impact of both packet loss and interfering traffic on the reduction performance of the DDPG adaptive ADRC controller is investigated, simultaneously.

Although these technique was quite well-received by telecommunication fields, very few of those made use on real AGV application. We prefer using CSI to applying Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) because of its robust accuracy in the indoor environment which had been tested in our first paper.

Many, if not all, smartphones are equipped with a powerful sensor set (GPS, WiFi, the acceleration sensor, the orientation sensor, etc.), which makes them capable of accomplishing complicated tasks. Unfortunately, as the core enabler of most location tracking applications on smartphones, GPS incurs an unacceptable energy cost that can cause the complete battery drain within a few hours. Although GPS is often preferred over its alternatives, the coverage areas of GPS are still limited (GPS typically cannot function indoors). To this end, our goal in this paper is to improve the energy-efficiency of traditional location tracking service as well as to expand its coverage areas. In this paper, we introduce SensTrack, a location tracking service that leverages the sensor hints on the smartphone to reduce the usage of GPS. SensTrack selectively executes a GPS sampling using the information from the acceleration and orientation sensors and switches to the alternate location sensing method based on WiFi when users move indoors. A machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, is then employed to reconstruct the trajectory from the recorded location samples. We implemented a prototype on an Android smartphone that can sample the related sensors during the user's movement and collect the sensor data for further processing on PCs. Evaluation on traces from real users demonstrates that SensTrack can significantly reduce the usage of GPS and still achieve a high tracking accuracy.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2013.2274074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6563204","Location tracking;smartphone;sensor","Global Positioning System;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Trajectory;Magnetic sensors;Accuracy;Mobile handsets","learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;mobility management (mobile radio);smart phones","SensTrack;energy-efficient location tracking;smartphone sensors;powerful sensor set;acceleration sensor;GPS;machine learning technique","","54","3","24","","18 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper introduces a deep learning enabled passive radio sensing method that can monitor human respiration and daily activities through leveraging unplanned and ever-present wireless bursts in the ISM frequency band, and can be employed as an additional data input within healthcare informatics. Wireless connected biomedical sensors (Medical Things) rely on coding and modulating of the sensor data onto wireless (radio) bursts which comply with specific physical layer standards like 802.11, 802.15.1 or 802.15.4. The increasing use of these unplanned connected sensors has led to a pell-mell of radio bursts which limit the capacity and robustness of communication channels to deliver data, whilst also increasing inter-system interference. This paper presents a novel methodology to disentangle the chaotic bursts in congested radio environments in order to provide healthcare informatics. The radio bursts are treated as pseudo noise waveforms which eliminate the requirement to extract embedded information through signal demodulation or decoding. Instead, we leverage the phase and frequency components of these radio bursts in conjunction with cross ambiguity function (CAF) processing and a Deep Transfer Network (DTN). We use 2.4GHz 802.11 (WiFi) signals to demonstrate experimentally the capability of this technique for human respiration detection (including through-the-wall), and classifying everyday but complex human motions such as standing, sitting and falling.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966126","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:326654); Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/R018677/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8957049","Machine learning;deep transfer networks;opportunistic wireless networks;signs-of-life detection;human activity monitoring;micro-Doppler signature;phase-sensitive detection","Sensors;Biomedical monitoring;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication;Monitoring;Medical services;Informatics","assisted living;biosensors;medical signal processing;patient monitoring;wireless channels","deep transfer network;cross ambiguity function;phase components;frequency components;signal decoding;signal demodulation;embedded information;intersystem interference;communication channels;human respiration;deep learning enabled passive radio sensing method;pervasive deployment;activity detection;congested radio environments;chaotic bursts;radio bursts;wireless connected biomedical sensors;healthcare informatics;ISM frequency band;wireless bursts;home environments","","6","","45","CCBY","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Firstly, an improved fingerprint database model named omnidirectional fingerprint database (ODFD) is proposed, which includes the position, orientation and the sequence of mean received signal strength indicator at each reference point. Secondly, affinity propagation clustering (APC) algorithm is introduced for clustering on the offline stage based on the hybrid distance, which is the fusion of signal-domain distance and position-domain distance. Finally, adaptive weighted KNN algorithm based on APC is proposed. KNN method is exploited to obtain K initial reference points (RPs), then all of them are clustered by APC algorithm based on RPs' position-domain distances. The most probable cluster is reserved by the comparison of RPs' number and signal-domain distance between cluster center and test point. The weighted average coordinate value of residual RPs in the remaining cluster can be estimated. We have implemented the proposed method with the mean error of 2.2 meters, the root mean square error of 1.5 meters.

We study the problem of optimal user targeting and monetization through advertising, from the point of view of the owner of a venue such as a shopping mall, an urban shopping district or an airport. The fundamental distinguishing characteristic of advertising in this setup is that the probability that the user will respond to an ad depends on timeliness of ad projection, hence it is important to target a mobile user with an appropriate ad or offer at the right time. A set of mobile users roam around the venue. Each user is profiled in terms of preferences based on prior visits. The system knows estimated instantaneous locations of users in the venue, e.g. through WiFi access point connectivity. A machine-learning model is used to derive a per-user time-varying probability of response to an ad, which depends on the relevance of the ad (store) to the user profile and on the time-varying physical proximity of the user to the store. Each store has a set of available ads, and each time the user responds to a projected ad, an amount is paid by the store to the venue owner. We use a stochastic-optimization framework based on Lyapunov optimization to address the problem of advertisement selection and allocation for maximizing the long-term average revenue of the venue owner subject to: (i) a constraint on maximum average ad projection rate per user for preventing user saturation, and (ii) a long-term average budget constraint for each store. We derive an algorithm that operates on a time slot basis by solving a simple assignment problem with instantaneous user locations while being agnostic to user mobility statistics. We test our algorithm with a real dataset of check-ins from Foursquare, complemented with data from user questionnaires. Our approach results in substantial improvement in revenue compared to approaches that are location- or relevance-agnostic.","","978-3-9018-8290-6","10.23919/WIOPT.2017.7959886","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959886","","Advertising;Mobile communication;Optimization;Wireless fidelity;Resource management;Social network services;Trajectory","advertising data processing;mobile computing;optimisation;probability","personalized location-based mobile advertising;stochastic optimization framework;mobile user;machine-learning model;per-user time-varying probability;user time-varying physical proximity;stochastic-optimization framework;Lyapunov optimization;advertisement selection problem;venue owner long-term average revenue maximization;long-term average budget constraint;user saturation;user mobility statistics;check-in dataset;user questionnaires","","3","","23","","29 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of them are location based, where location data is used either as main or as auxiliary information. However, the location service is power hungry. Thus, a major challenge is the optimization of the trade-off between resources usage of the location service and its accuracy. We introduce the architecture of the Enhanced Localization Solution (ELS), an efficient localization strategy for smartphones which smartly combines the standard location tracking techniques (e.g., GPS, GSM and WiFi localization), the newly built-in technologies, as well as Human Mobility Modelling and Machine Learning techniques.

Prior work demonstrated the effectiveness of a variety of contextual sensor modalities for this purpose, including audio-radio environment (ambient audio, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS, and combinations thereof) and physical environment (temperature, humidity, gas, and altitude, and combinations thereof). In this paper, we present a systematic assessment of such co-presence detection in the presence of a strong, context-manipulating attacker against unattended terminals. First, we show that it is feasible to manipulate, consistently control, and stabilize the readings of different acoustic and physical environment sensors (and even multiple sensors simultaneously) using low-cost, off-the-shelf equipment. Specifically, we show that it is possible to control the temperature using a home-grade hair dryer, affect the gas readings using a smoking cigarette, impact the altitude/pressure with a simple air compressor, or relay audio signals recorded at one end to the other thereby causing both sides to perceive a very similar acoustic environment. Second, based on these capabilities and the strengthened threat model, we show that an attacker who can manipulate the context gains a significant advantage in defeating contextual co-presence detection. For systems that use multiple sensors, we investigate two sensor fusion approaches based on machine learning classification techniques-features-fusion and decisions-fusion, and show that both are vulnerable to context manipulation attacks but the latter approach can be more resistant in some cases. We further consider other defensive approaches that may be used to reduce the impact of even such a strong context-manipulating attacker. Our work represents the first concrete step towards analyzing, extending, and systematizing prior work on contextual co-presence detection under a stronger, but realistic adversarial model.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2839604","US National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1526524,CNS-1547350); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:274951,309994); Intel Corporation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8362740","Sensors;environmental sensors;context manipulation;relay attack","Authentication;Relays;Context modeling;Protocols;Temperature sensors;Wireless fidelity","audio signals;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;pattern classification;sensor fusion;telecommunication security","contextual co-presence detection;sensor fusion approaches;context manipulation attacks;context-centric sensor-based proximity detection;relay attacks;mobile authentication systems;unattended terminals;unmonitored parking lots;remote gas station pumps;contextual sensor modalities;audio-radio environment;ambient audio;physical environment;gas readings;relay audio signals;acoustic environment;context-manipulating attacker;temperature control;home-grade hair dryer;machine learning classification;features-fusion;decisions-fusion","","8","","32","IEEE","22 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To tackle the problem with GPS, varied WiFi-based positioning schemes have been proposed. However, the positioning precision of the existing methods is not satisfactory. In this paper, we present a high-precision positioning scheme named Deep Learning based Positioning (DLP). Technically, DLP utilizes both Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Channel State Information (CSI) to improve the positioning precision. In detail, a deep neural network is used to model the received RSSI and CSI measurements, which leads to satisfactory positioning accuracy.

An efficient model with high positioning accuracy is therefore not yet available. We propose a stacking ensemble broad learning localization system using channel state information as a fingerprint, which is termed EnsemLoca. A bootstrapping method is used to build the training set, which enables the EnsemLoca system to build the base learner in parallel by using bagging. The broad learning system (BLS), which is a novel neural network model, as a base learner, not only has the advantage of time complexity but also offers a sparse representation in which the features are filtered. A unique base learner is constructed by randomly selecting the samples and features, and they are combined by stack generalization. The experimental results show that the EnsemLoca system achieves higher accuracy than several machine-learning algorithms in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS environments, and is even stronger than deep neural networks characterized by accuracy. At the same time, it has the same theoretical complexity as BLS, which greatly reduces the offline training time.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3097511","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2019YFB1703601); Joint Funds of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U2001204); Tianjin Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:20JCJQJC00250); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2020M680906); Hebei Province High-Level Talent Funding Project(grant numbers:B202003027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9486950","Broad learning system (BLS);channel state information (CSI);intelligent localization;Internet of Things","Training;Complexity theory;Bagging;Internet of Things;Feature extraction;Location awareness;Learning systems","","","","","","33","IEEE","15 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This model uses random forest based cross validation to train itself and perform indoor localization. The SDN framework is responsible for coordinating the IoT devices and monitoring security threats. The system is tested using Wi-Fi signals obtained from seven different routers. The highest accuracy of 98.3% is achieved using k-fold cross validation of 3 and mtry = 2.

Dependability of such systems is challenged by the reliability of the communication links between various sub-systems. In this paper, we address this issue by designing a TCP/I P based Client-Server architecture using diverse channels, to ensure zero tolerance with regards to outage of service. The prototype system uses Raspberry Pi 3, as a remote client, to intelligently communicate with the server node by choosing one or a set of available communication links, e.g., Ethernet (LAN), Wireless-LAN (Wi-Fi), and Bluetooth channels. We further implement the system using Open Services Gateway Initiative (OSGi), a modular and interpolate-able code foundation, to withstand the challenges faced by the modern software industry e.g. complexity and scalability. Prototype system was successfully tested for hardware and software fault tolerance using different test scenarios to ensure uninterrupted service delivery.

In fact, the use of internet is becoming wider with the diversity of possible offered services, going from emailing, Data and video transfers, to IoT. The number of internet users has reached multimillions of people these last two decades, in addition, they are willing to connect wirelessly anytime and anywhere, to the best available technology, under the Always Best-Connected paradigm (ABC). The mobile terminals are nowadays, equipped with multiple interfaces, allowing them, to connect to any available wireless access technology, and this provokes vertical handovers to happen. The vertical handover is the changing of the wireless access technology (Ex: from Wi-Fi to 4G), unlike the horizontal handover, which means changing the base station or access point, while staying within the same wireless technology. Thus, the vertical handover process needs to be improved, especially the decision phase, which is the most crucial, while the sensors and antennas' technologies are developing very fast, to collect more efficient metrics, to make faster and more precise decisions anytime. Many theories have been used to deal with the vertical handover decision making, like utility function, fuzzy theory, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and Multi-Attributes Decision Making (MADM). Naturally, MADM methods are the most suitable for this kind of decision making issues. Moreover, these algorithms are relatively simple to implement, and are executing fast enough, to ensure a “seamless” handover, without interrupting the services and sessions. The aim of this paper is to investigate which MADM combination is relatively the best, amongst 120 combinations of MADM methods compared.","","978-1-5386-2123-3","10.1109/WINCOM.2017.8238169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8238169","MADM methods;Network selection;Vertical handover;Wireless access networks","Handover;Decision making;Mobile communication;Wireless fidelity;Wireless networks","decision making;fuzzy set theory;mobile antennas;mobility management (mobile radio)","video transfers;horizontal handover;base station;vertical handover process;decision phase;vertical handover decision making;MADM methods;seamless handover;Internet;wireless access technology;antenna technology;multiattributes decision making;IoT;always best-connected paradigm;ABC;mobile terminals;sensors;utility function;fuzzy theory;neural networks;artificial intelligence","","5","","20","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to keep a reasonable size of the radio map, a dimension control strategy has been proposed.

Indoor positioning based on channel state information (CSI) becomes a research hotspot because it can provide fine-grained information. This paper proposes the Adaboost positioning system (ABPS) that uses the phase information in CSI and the ensemble learning (EL) method to train the fingerprint map. In this system, the abnormal phase data is eliminated by density-based clustering and the remainder is linearly transformed to build the fingerprint map. Through continuous iteration with the Adaboost algorithm, the sample weights of the training sets are continuously adjusted to prepare for classification. Finally, it can achieve position coordinates regression by means of confidence level. A series of experiments have been conducted to illustrate the effects of EL parameters, such as the number of iterations, the maximum depth of decision tree, the maximum number of features, and the minimum number of samples required for node subdivision. Meanwhile, the influence of input data sets size is investigated in an open environment and a complex laboratory environment.

The key insight underlying SoNIC is that different interferers disrupt individual 802.15.4 packets in characteristic ways that can be detected by sensor nodes. In contrast to existing approaches to interference detection, SoNIC does not rely on active spectrum sampling or additional hardware, making it lightweight and energy-efficient. In an office environment with multiple interferers, a sensor node running SoNIC correctly detects the predominant interferer 87% of the time.

In this paper, we introduce a novel RF-based vehicle motion detection and speed estimation system (ReVISE). Our system leverages the fact that the presence of objects in an RF environment affects the received signal strength and hence, can be used to detect and identify different characteristics of the objects in an area of interest. Our long-term vision for ReVISE is to leverage common wireless networks, such as WiFi or cellular, to detect the density of traffic and estimate the car speed based on the mobile devices carried by users. This gives us an edge over the current techniques for traffic estimation as we do not require any specialized hardware and the cellular signal strength information is available from all cell phones, providing large-scale ubiquitous traffic estimation. We present the design and analysis of ReVISE including its vehicle detection and speed estimation modules. The detection module can differentiate between an empty street, stationary cars, and moving cars based on a multi-class SVM approach that uses features from the RF signal strength. We also present two novel speed estimation techniques based on statistical and curve fitting approaches. Evaluation of ReVISE in a real testbed shows that the proposed techniques can detect vehicle motion with an accuracy of 100% and estimate the vehicle speed with an accuracy of 90% in typical streets. This highlights the feasibility and promise of using RF for vehicle detection and speed estimation.","1550-2252","978-1-4673-0990-5","10.1109/VETECS.2012.6240184","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6240184","","Vehicles;Estimation;Vehicle detection;Accuracy;Wireless communication;Support vector machines;Monitoring","cellular radio;curve fitting;radionavigation;signal detection;statistical analysis;support vector machines;traffic information systems;wireless LAN","RF-based vehicle detection-speed estimation system;driving condition;traffic jams;ReVISE reliability;ReVISE robustness;received signal strength;object characteristic identification;object characteristic detection;wireless networks;WiFi;cellular network;traffic density detection;mobile devices;traffic estimation;cellular signal strength information;large-scale ubiquitous traffic estimation;vehicle detection-speed estimation modules;empty street;stationary cars;moving cars;multiclass SVM approach;RF signal strength;statistical approach;curve fitting approach;vehicle motion detection","","49","","14","","16 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although the identity of a node can be verified through cryptographic authentication, conventional security approaches are not always desirable because of their overhead requirements. In this paper, we propose to use spatial information, a physical property associated with each node, hard to falsify, and not reliant on cryptography, as the basis for 1) detecting spoofing attacks; 2) determining the number of attackers when multiple adversaries masquerading as the same node identity; and 3) localizing multiple adversaries. We propose to use the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes to detect the spoofing attacks. We then formulate the problem of determining the number of attackers as a multiclass detection problem. Cluster-based mechanisms are developed to determine the number of attackers. When the training data are available, we explore using the Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to further improve the accuracy of determining the number of attackers. In addition, we developed an integrated detection and localization system that can localize the positions of multiple attackers. We evaluated our techniques through two testbeds using both an 802.11 (WiFi) network and an 802.15.4 (ZigBee) network in two real office buildings.

A promising approach for indoor localization is to leverage the pervasive WiFi infrastructure via fingerprinting-based inference. However, a WiFi device must frequently scan for WiFi signals during localization, leading to high power consumption. Moreover, switching to the scanning mode introduces inevitable disruptions to data communication of WiFi interface. This paper presents a new indoor localization system called ZiFind that exploits the cross-technology interference in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum. ZiFind utilizes low-power ZigBee interface to collect WiFi interference signals and adopts digital signal processing techniques to extract unique signatures as fingerprints for localization. To deal with the noise in the fingerprints, we design a new learning algorithm called R-KNN that can improve the accuracy of localization by assigning different weights to fingerprint features according to their importance. We implement ZiFind on TelosB motes and evaluate its performance through extensive experiments in a 16,000 ft<sup>2</sup> office building floor consisting of 28 rooms.

Therefore, efficient and precise humidity measurement techniques are indispensable. However, the existing off-the-shelf techniques, including the dry and wet bulb hygrometer, humidity sensor as well as WiFi based detector, all fail to achieve a sensitive, accurate and convenient humidity measurement, especial for a large scale deployment. In this paper, we observe that different levels of water vapor have certain impact on millimeter wave (mmWave) signals in indoor environments. Accordingly, we propose an fine-grained environmental humidity sensing technology via wireless signals in the mmWave band. However, mmWave signals are not only sensitive to humidity, but also other environmental factors, such as oxygen. To establish a linear relationship between humidity and mm Wave signal propagation, we exploit a subspace projection technique to remove the environmental noise. Upon extracting the humidity-associated features in the noise-free signal, we utilize support vector machine (SVM) to model the humidity measurement classifier of a certain place. Extensive experiments have been conducted in different scenarios in order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. Results show that the average accuracy of humidity measurement is up to 85 % when the humidity interval is 3 %, and is 95 % when the humidity interval is 5%. We further show that the proposed method is very sensitive to the humidity dynamics and is 63.2 times faster compared to the traditional hygrometers.","1521-9097","978-1-5386-7308-9","10.1109/PADSW.2018.8644907","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644907","","Humidity;Humidity measurement;Electromagnetic scattering;Wireless fidelity;Atmospheric modeling;Indoor environment;Attenuation","computerised instrumentation;humidity measurement;humidity sensors;hygrometers;millimetre wave detectors;millimetre wave measurement;support vector machines","environmental factors;subspace projection technique;humidity measurement classifier techniques;mmwave signal propagation;millimeter wave signal propagation;industrial production;WiFi based detector;water vapor;indoor environments;environmental noise removal;support vector machine;SVM;wireless signals;fine-grained environmental humidity sensing technology;wet bulb hygrometer;dry bulb hygrometer;atmospheric humidity;fine-grained humidity sensing;noise-free signal","","1","","15","","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For helping users with effective fitness evaluation in home environment and encouraging them to keep exercising, this paper presents a non-invasive, low-cost and high-precision fitness assistance system based on the commercial WIFI device. The IFC(Invisible Fitness Coach) system applies the CSI(Channel State Information) signal to perceive the user's exercise information in home, and accurately divides the continuous actions via the principal component variance, and then extracts the features from each completed action to train a multi-class SVM model to recognize them, finally, it analyzes the user's exercise frequency, intensity, duration, etc., then feeds back the comprehensive analysis based on the above features to him/her.

In this paper, we propose to use spatial information, a physical property associated with each node, hard to falsify, and not reliant on cryptography, as the basis for detecting spoofing attacks, determining the number of attackers when multiple adversaries masquerading as asame node identity; and localizing multiple adversaries. We propose to use the spatial correlation of received signal strength (RSS) inherited from wireless nodes to detect the spoofing attacks. We then formulate the problem of determining the number of attackers as multiclass detection problem. Cluster based mechanisms is developed to determine the number of attackers. When the training data is available, we explore using Support Vector Machines (SVM) method to further improve the accuracy of determining the number of attackers. In addition, we developed an integrated detection and localization system that can localize the positions of multiple attackers. We evaluated our techniques through two test beds using both an 802.11 (Wi-Fi) network and an 802.15.4 (ZigBee) network in two real office buildings. Our experimental results show that our proposed methods can achieve over 90% Hit Rate and Precision when determining the number of attackers. Our localization results using a representative set of algorithms provide strong evidence of high accuracy of localizing multiple adversaries.","","978-1-4799-3834-6","10.1109/ICICES.2014.7034164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7034164","Wireless network security;spoofing attack;attack detection;localization","Wireless communication;Communication system security;Cryptography;Accuracy;Support vector machines;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Educational institutions","cryptography;support vector machines;telecommunication security;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","ZigBee network;real office buildings;attacker number determination;802.15.4 network;Wi-Fi network;802.11 network;multiple-attacker position localization;integrated detection-localization system;SVM method;support vector machine method;multiclass detection problem;wireless nodes;RSS;received signal strength;spatial correlation;multiple-adversary localization;node identity;spoofing attack detection;physical property;spatial information;overhead requirement;conventional security approach;cryptographic authentication;wireless spoofing attacks;WSN;multiple-spoofing attackers;cluster-based mechanism","","2","","11","","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the subsequent IEEE 802.15.4-2015 standard, a Time-slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mechanism has been developed which allows for a periodic yet fixed frequency hopping pattern over 16 different channels. Unfortunately, however, most of these channels are susceptible to high-power coexisting Wi-Fi signal interference and to possibly some other ISM-band transmissions. This interference manifests itself in the form of the presence/absence of other devices with either or both static and dynamic channel selection policies. In order to isolate channels with undesirable conditions, blacklisting mechanisms are defined to adapt the channel hopping process. However, the existing solutions which form blacklists unrealistically assume that the statistical model of the external interference remains fixed, and do not vary over time. In this paper, we realistically assume that the impact of external interferes on 802.15.4 may generally follow a non-stationary pattern, and accordingly formulate the adaptive channel hopping problem as a Dynamic Multi-Armed Bernoulli Bandit (Dynamic MABB) process from the machine learning theory. We then propose an online learning algorithm with track-ability properties for computing an adaptive hopping policy. Simulations confirm that when the statistics of the external interference has a switching regime, the proposed solution outperforms the previous schemes in terms of both energy efficiency as well as two important KPIs for TSCH-based networks, i.e., PDR and latency.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3110720","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530419","IEEE 802.15.4;TSCH;channel hopping;blacklisting;dynamic MABB problem","Interference;Adaptation models;Heuristic algorithms;IEEE 802.15 Standard;Blacklisting;Standards;Sensors","access protocols;frequency hop communication;interference suppression;learning (artificial intelligence);radio networks;radiofrequency interference;telecommunication network reliability;wireless channels;wireless LAN;wireless sensor networks;Zigbee","TSCH-based networks;increased energy consumption;high network delay;poor packet delivery ratio;PDR;subsequent IEEE 802;Time-slotted Channel Hopping mechanism;periodic yet fixed frequency hopping pattern;high-power coexisting Wi-Fi signal interference;ISM-band transmissions;static channel selection policies;dynamic channel selection policies;blacklisting mechanisms;channel hopping process;form blacklists;external interference;external interferes;nonstationary pattern;adaptive channel hopping problem;adaptive hopping policy;dynamic MABB;dynamic multiarmed Bernoulli bandit process","","","","55","IEEE","6 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Furthermore, methods based on probabilistic model or data fusion do not consider the uneven spatial resolution of the Wi-Fi RSSI. Therefore, in order to improve the positioning accuracy of traditional location algorithms, this paper proposes a new weighted algorithm based on the physical distance of the RSSI.

High mobile data usage has implications both for users and providers. For individual users, relying on cellular data connectivity incurs high cellular data fees. For cellular network providers, high mobile data usage requires expensive, ongoing infrastructure upgrades. Cellular data usage can be reduced by offloading to WiFi when available. If not available, prior work has considered delaying transmissions to wait for WiFi availability. While exploiting such application delay tolerance offers significant energy and performance leverage for data offloading and other techniques, a key question is: how long to wait? Prior work does not discuss how to estimate application delay tolerance without explicit help from programmers, nor how to adjust the estimate dynamically. This work proposes, implements, and evaluates four schemes to dynamically and adaptively deduce an application's delay tolerance. These schemes (Adaptive, Decision Tree-Based, Hybrid and Lazy) are low-overhead and effective. In our experiments, they cut cellular usage by 2× or more compared to non-delay-tolerant approaches. Furthermore, our dynamically adaptive decision schemes achieve up to 15% further cellular data reduction compared to fixed static delay tolerance values.","0743-166X","978-1-4799-8381-0","10.1109/INFOCOM.2015.7218571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7218571","","Delays;Electronic mail;IEEE 802.11 Standard;Receivers;Mobile communication;Decision trees","cellular radio;delays;Internet;telecommunication traffic","dynamic adaptive techniques;learning application delay tolerance;mobile data offloading;mobile data traffic;Internet traffic;cellular data connectivity;cellular data fees;cellular network providers;WiFi availability;delay tolerance;cellular data reduction;fixed static delay tolerance values","","12","1","25","","24 Aug 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve this issue, we propose a lightweight differential privacy-preserving mechanism for the edge computing environment. We extend ε-differential privacy theory to a mature machine learning localization technology to achieve privacy protection while training the localization model. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets show that, compared with the original localization technology without privacy-preserving, our proposed scheme can achieve high accuracy of indoor localization while providing differential privacy guarantee. Through regulating the value of ε, the data quality loss of our method can be controlled up to 8.9% and the time consumption can be almost negligible.

This paper analyzes the performance of this FTM implementation by carrying out and studying several measurement campaigns in different indoor and outdoor scenarios. Additionally, this work proposes an alternative real-time implementation for distance estimation inside the ESP32 using an approach based on machine learning.

However, the openness of wireless transmission raises privacy concerns since human behaviors could expose massive private information of users, which impedes the real-world implementation of RF-based user authentication applications. It is difficult to filter out the behavior information from the collected RF signals. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving deep neural network named BPCloak to erase the behavior information in RF signals while retaining the ability of user authentication. We conduct extensive experiments over mainstream RF signals collected from three real wireless systems, including the WiFi, radio frequency identification (RFID), and millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems. The experimental results show that BPCloak significantly reduces the behavior recognition accuracy, i.e., 85%+, 75%+, and 65%+ reduction for WiFi, RFID, and mmWave systems respectively, merely with a slight penalty of accuracy decrease when using these three systems for user authentication, i.e., 1%-, 3%-, and 5%-, respectively.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2022.3143880","Alibaba-Zhejiang University Joint Institute of Frontier Technologies; Ant Group Funding(grant numbers:Z51202000234); Leading Innovative and Entrepreneur Team Introduction Program of Zhejiang(grant numbers:2018R01005); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021QY0703); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52178175,61872285, 62032021, and 61772236,61972348,U21A20462); Zhejiang Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2019C03133); Research Institute of Cyberspace Governance in Zhejiang University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684968","RF Sensing;Behavior Recognition;Privacy Preserving;Deep Learning","RF signals;Privacy;Authentication;Transmitters;Receivers;Radio frequency;Sensors","","","","","","","IEEE","19 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Therefore, the characteristics of smartphone traffic need to be considered when designing mobile core networks. Smartphone traffic is categorized by whether it is generated from user interaction (foreground (FG) traffic) or not (background (BG) traffic), and such traffic types can be managed differently to efficiently maintain the communication quality in the case of network congestion. However, it is difficult to distinguish such traffic types and their characteristics solely by IP addresses/port numbers. In addition, the increase in HTTPS traffic makes application-level packet inspection difficult. In this paper, we propose a traffic classification method on a mobile core network. The proposed method captures packets on the mobile core network, constructs TCP flows, and labels each flow by considering the regularity of BG traffic and the randomness of FG traffic using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with selected feature indexes obtained from the TCP/IP layer. Also, we attempt to restrict the indexes that can be obtained in the observation of the initial part of each TCP flow in order to reduce the calculation cost. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of the classification accuracy using experimental data through the Wi-Fi connections of smartphones. The full-index classifier using 40 indexes classifies FG and BG traffic with 97.2% accuracy and the shortcut-index classifier using restricted 36 indexes also indicates 94.4% accuracy.","2163-5595","978-1-4799-8576-0","10.1109/CQR.2015.7129082","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7129082","","Indexes;Smart phones;Mobile communication;Mobile computing;Accuracy;Uplink;IP networks","smart phones;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic;transport protocols","traffic classification;mobile core network;background traffic regularity;multimedia contents;smartphone traffic;network congestion;HTTPS traffic;application-level packet inspection;traffic classification method;TCP-IP layer;support vector machine classifier;Wi-Fi connections","","6","","13","","25 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the vulnerabilities discovered in IoT products are often difficult to eliminate because, most of the time, they cannot be patched easily. Therefore, protection mechanisms are needed to mitigate the potential risks induced by such objects in private and public connected areas.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect potential attacks in smart places (e.g. smart homes) by detecting deviations from legitimate communication behavior, in particular at the physical layer.

In order to achieve good positioning results, much effort has been made to develop advanced KNN algorithms and to find the optimal K. So far most of the work has concentrated on using a fixed K for a given positioning system. A drawback is that the positioning system would become unstable since the best K at one place may not be the best for another. In order to address this problem, we propose a dynamic KNN algorithm that can adjust the value of K dynamically to offset noises of different levels. The value adjustment is made based on the WiFi signals measured in real-time, therefore, it does not require any prior knowledge of the WLAN or the indoor environment. Analysis on field measurement data shows that, for a large percentage of the positioning area, the best K is 1 instead of 3 or 5 found in previous studies. The field experiment also shows, by setting K=1, the proposed method can achieve better positioning accuracy compared with the classical KNN method.","","978-1-5386-2659-7","10.1109/IRI.2018.00054","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424725","Fingerprint positioning, indoor positioning, k-nearest neighbor","Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity;Time measurement;Buildings;Position measurement;Hardware;Heuristic algorithms","indoor radio;wireless LAN","K-nearest neighbor fingerprint indoor positioning;neighbor fingerprint positioning;WLAN-based indoor positioning;indoor environment","","","","19","","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most common algorithm adopted for Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based location sensing is K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), which calculates K nearest neighboring points to mobile users (MUs). Accordingly, in this paper, we aim to improve the KNN algorithm by enhancing the neighboring point selection by applying k-means clustering approach. In the proposed method, k-means clustering algorithm groups nearest neighbors according to their distance to mobile user. Then the closest group to the mobile user is used to calculate the MU's location.

Many indoor positioning techniques leverage wireless signals, such as WiFi and Bluetooth, but suffer from low accuracy. Therefore, fusion techniques have been proposed to improve the accuracy, such as using the inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based fusion system using IMU and Visible Light Positioning (VLP). Different from WiFi and Bluetooth systems, VLP can provide highly accurate and fast location service with several line-of-sight (LOS) visible lights due to the special characteristic of light. Although VLP could fail in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) condition, the fusion system that we proposed is based on several structured neural networks and can carefully select VLP signals to achieve better positioning results even under poor LOS conditions. Based on our simulation results, the system can achieve an average of 20 cm accuracy.","","978-1-6654-6667-7","10.1109/IUCC-CIT-DSCI-SmartCNS55181.2021.00093","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9719670","pedestrian navigation;deep learning;fusion positioning;visible light;signal shadowing","Wireless communication;Wireless sensor networks;Bluetooth;Simulation;Sensor fusion;Ubiquitous computing;Sensors","","","","","","17","","3 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The distinctive feature of a majority of LBT-based systems is that the transmitters use preambles that precede the data to allow the receivers to perform packet detection and carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation. Preambles usually contain repetitions of training symbols with good correlation properties, while conventional digital receivers apply correlation-based methods for both packet detection and CFO estimation. However, in recent years, data-based machine learning methods are disrupting physical layer research. Promising results have been presented, in particular, in the domain of deep learning (DL)-based channel estimation. In this paper, we present a performance and complexity analysis of packet detection and CFO estimation using both the conventional and the DL-based approaches. The goal of the study is to investigate under which conditions the performance of the DL-based methods approach or even surpass the conventional methods, but also, under which conditions their performance is inferior.

Because disclosing one's location can be valuable but risky, many services and studies employ a user's GPS coordinates to determine automatically whether or not those coordinates can be disclosed by comparing them with handcrafted rules or privacy models trained using the user's actual preferences. However, these approaches that employ GPS coordinates constitute a drain on a phone's battery when the services assume continuous location sharing. In addition, recent positioning methods (assisted GPS and a WiFi-based positioning) rely on external location providers. That is, when a user's current location preference is determined using her coordinate point, her location information is disclosed to external providers even if this is not her wish. In this paper, we explore a way of learning a user's location privacy preference using sensors that are energy saving and that do not rely on external providers. This enables us to save energy and protect a user's privacy when she is unwilling to disclose her location. Note that the machine learning-based approach cannot deal well with a user's private situations that are not included in its training data. So, this paper proposes a new model that can determine a user's privacy preferences and handle such outlying situations.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2014.2335537","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6850005","J.9.a location-dependent and sensitive;J.9.d pervasive computing;K.4.1.f privacy","Sensors;Privacy;Global Positioning System;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Mobile handsets;Feature extraction;Data privacy","computer network security;data privacy;Global Positioning System;mobile computing;mobile handsets;telecommunication security;wireless LAN","GPS location data;mobile phones;current locations;GPS coordinates;handcrafted rules;privacy models;continuous location sharing;recent positioning methods;external location providers","","5","","29","OAPA","8 Jul 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Thus, the VH process needs to be improved, especially the decision phase, which is the most crucial, while the sensors and antennas' technologies are developing very fast, to collect more efficient metrics, to make more precise decisions anytime. To deal with VH decision making problems, different theories have been used, like utility function, fuzzy theory, neural networks, artificial intelligence, and Multi-Attributes Decision Making (MADM). Naturally, MADM methods are the most suitable for this kind of decision making issues, moreover, these algorithms are relatively simple to implement, and are executing fast enough, to ensure a “seamless” handover, without the session breaking. In this paper, we present a comparison study of two hybrid methods, which are the results of the combination of the fuzzy logic and two MADM methods, the hybrid methods are named the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preferences by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) and the Fuzzy Gray Relational Analysis (FGRA). These methods are compared to see which one is relatively the best in the context of VH decision making problem, which is the network selection.","","978-1-5090-4062-9","10.1109/ISACV.2017.8054983","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8054983","Fuzzy logic;Network selection;Vertical handover;Wireless networks;Multi access environment","Handover;Decision making;Wireless fidelity;Manganese;Mobile communication;Wireless communication","decision making;fuzzy logic;fuzzy set theory;grey systems;Internet;mobility management (mobile radio);TOPSIS","ABC paradigm;ABC paradigm;always best connected paradigm;MADM method;wireless access technology;internet users;infinite issues;vertical handover decision making;fuzzy GRA;fuzzy TOPSIS;Fuzzy Gray Relational Analysis;Fuzzy Technique;fuzzy logic;hybrid methods;seamless handover;decision making issues;MultiAttributes Decision;fuzzy theory;VH decision making problem;antennas;decision phase;VH process;wireless technology;base station;horizontal handover","","1","","19","","2 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Presently an experienced plant pathologist can diagnose the condition through visual inspection of disease-affected plants. However, manual visualization is time-consuming and depends on the plant pathologist's expertise in identifying plant disease. Hence this problem can be solved by a computer-aided diagnostic system with artificial intelligence (CADS-AI). This system will aid in improving and protecting the yield of the plant, but it lacks trust as the existing system is not flawless. Hence, in this research work, a plant disease classification with an explainable AI pipeline is developed which ensures trust in the CADS solution. Furthermore, an expert recommendation system will act as an alternative to expert plant pathologists. Tomato leaf diseases data from the PlantVillage dataset is used in the proposed solution. Transfer learning technique was adopted in training deep neural network models with original and augmented data of 16,684 and 53,476 images respectively. The best model for the dataset was efficientNet B5 with best F1 score accuracy of 0.9842 and 0.9930.

We focus on addressing the challenge of real-time signal quality assessment (SQA) and lightweight QRS detection for wearable ECG application. First, a combination method of multiple signal quality indices and machine learning is proposed for classifying 10-s single-channel ECG segments as acceptable and unacceptable. Then a lightweight QRS detector is developed for accurate location of QRS complexes. The results show that the proposed SQA method can efficiently deal with tradeoff between accepting good (97.9%) and rejecting poor (96.4%) quality ECGs, ensuring that only a low percentage of recorded ECGs are discarded. The proposed lightweight QRS detector achieves a F<sub>1</sub> score higher than 99.5% for processing clean ECGs. Meanwhile, it reports significantly higher F<sub>1</sub> scores than two existing QRS detectors for processing noisy ECGs. In addition, it also has a fine computation efficiency.

Mission-critical and sensitive applications like aircraft operations and control systems, online banking systems will need minimum latency and quick response time. To address these issues and provide cloud services available to the proximity of edge users without causing delays (like processing delays, network delays, etc.), the concept of fog computing came into existence. Fog computing makes real-time data available to mobile users without any delays close to the edge of the network. With the decline of saffron cultivation in the last decade due to numerous arid and climatic challenges, the Internet of Things (IoT) seems to be an impeccable solution for its cultivation. In this research contribution, a fog-assisted information model for saffron cultivation has been proposed which delivers information to all saffron cultivators as a cloud service using IoT and fog, thus eradicating the possibilities of latency and storage issues. Also, the services offered by the fog node using the ESP32 Wi-Fi module are discussed. To implement the proposed model, data gathered from sensor nodes is stored on the cloud and big data analytics is performed on collected data. Simultaneously, machine learning technology will be used to facilitate increased crop yield in making proper decisions for all the saffron cultivators in smart farming.

Our 33 living lab participants rated their mobile applications' QoE in various contexts for four weeks resulting in a total of 5663 QoE ratings. At the same time, our smartphone logger (mQoL-Log) collected background information such as network information, user activity, battery statistics and more. We focused this study on frequently used and highly interactive applications including Google Chrome, Google Maps, Spotify, Instagram, Facebook, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. After pre-processing the dataset, we used classical machine learning techniques and algorithms (Extreme Gradient Boosting) to predict the QoE of the application usage. The results showed that our model can predict the user QoE with 94±0.77 accuracy. Surprisingly, after the following top three features: session length, battery level and network QoS, the user activity (e.g., if walking) and intended action to accomplish with the app were the most predictive features. Longer application use sessions often have worse QoE than shorter sessions.","2472-7814","978-1-5386-8212-8","10.1109/QoMEX.2019.8743306","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743306","Quality of Experience;QoE Prediction;Context;Quality of Service;Mobile Applications","Quality of experience;Quality of service;Batteries;Mobile applications;Wireless fidelity;Google;Predictive models","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;quality of experience;quality of service;smart phones;social networking (online)","Extreme Gradient Boosting;application usage;user QoE;battery level;user activity;predictive features;living lab study;hybrid method;cellular network;5663 QoE ratings;smartphone logger;collected background information;network information;battery statistics;highly interactive applications;mobile applications;Facebook;Google Maps;Google Chrome","","2","","24","","24 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The opportunity for doing so arises due to subtle nonlinear variations across transmitters, even those made by the same manufacturer. Since these effects are difficult to model explicitly, we investigate learning device fingerprints using complex-valued deep neural networks (DNNs) that take as input the complex baseband signal at the receiver. We ask whether such fingerprints can be made robust to distribution shifts across time and locations due to clock drift and variations in the wireless channel. In this paper, we point out that, unless proactively discouraged from doing so, DNNs learn these strong confounding features rather than the nonlinear device-specific characteristics that we seek to learn. We propose and evaluate strategies, based on augmentation and estimation, to promote generalization across realizations of these confounding factors, using WiFi data. We conclude that, while DNN training has the advantage of not requiring explicit signal models, significant modeling insights are required to focus the learning on the effects we wish to capture.","2576-2303","978-1-6654-5828-3","10.1109/IEEECONF53345.2021.9723393","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9723393","","Radio frequency;Wireless communication;Deep learning;Training;Transmitters;Estimation;Fingerprint recognition","","","","","","26","","4 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared with the wireless signals, the geomagnetic field signals inside buildings are influenced by ferromagnetic materials, which are significantly more stable for accurate indoor positioning. However, due to the location ambiguity problem, different positions may have similar geomagnetic readings, leading to significant positioning errors. Existing indoor geomagnetic positioning methods generally rely on single or short-sequence geomagnetic observations, which makes it difficult to discriminate between positions with similar geomagnetic values. Besides, geomagnetic anomalies can provide accurate position estimation within small-scale areas, but they cannot be utilized for large-scale localization due to the extensive existence of contour points and their rarity of remarkable geomagnetic anomalies. Therefore, we presents a geomagnetic indoor positioning algorithm based on two-level hierarchical LSTM (HLSTM) neural networks, which significantly increases the positioning accuracy by incorporating more historical geomagnetic observations. Based on the finding that geomagnetic signals are much stable, we adopt a sequence augmentation approach to generate a large number of geomagnetic trajectories for model training and testing instead of labor-extensive human collection. The HLSTM model is trained by the Pytorch framework with Cuda and cuDNN for parallel. Our proposed algorithm can obtain around 0.8m error of 67% probability on the self-collected ICT dataset and public MagPIE dataset. The results of the comparison experiment demonstrate that our proposed algorithm performs better accuracy and robustness when compared with other algorithms.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2021.3126731","National Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018YFB0505200); Action Plan Project of the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2019XD-A06); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61872046,62002026); Joint Research Fund for Beijing Natural Science Foundation and Haidian Original Innovation(grant numbers:L192004); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4212024); Key Research and Development Project from Hebei Province(grant numbers:19210404D,21310102D); Science and Technology Plan Project of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region(grant numbers:2019GG328); Open Project of the Beijing Key Laboratory of Mobile Computing and Pervasive Device; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606916","Location-based service;indoor geomagnetic positioning;data augmentation;hierarchical LSTM network","Location awareness;Sensors;Fingerprint recognition;Smart phones;Wireless communication;Buildings;Wireless fidelity","","","","","","30","IEEE","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The treatment of such a dataset is challenging, as improper application of the dataset might result in inaccurate location estimation. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm that makes the K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) regression robust to noises both in features and labels of the training data.

However, the fundamental challenge of existing fingerprinting localization is that the complicated indoor spatial structure brings great difficulty to exploit the relationship between received signal strength (RSS) distribution and the process of fingerprint matching. To address this problem, in this paper, we focus on integrating the signal pathloss model into distance metric learning, and a novel cost similar to the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor (LMNN) is designed to conduct offline metric learning procedure. The proposed metric learning, which is pathloss model practically considered to learn the mapping between signal strength distribution and physical space structure, aims to obtain a reasonable distance matrix for k Nearest Neighbor (KNN) based indoor localization. Experiment results corroborate that the proposed metric learning method can further improve the indoor localization accuracy compared with the conventional methods and its effectiveness is validated extensively in various cases for testing.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-0962-6","10.1109/GLOBECOM38437.2019.9013458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9013458","","Indoor environments;Attenuation;Fingerprint recognition;Wireless fidelity;Wireless communication;Extraterrestrial measurements","indoor communication;learning (artificial intelligence);nearest neighbour methods;RSSI;wireless LAN","smart mobile devices;communication standard;high-accuracy indoor localization;fingerprinting localization;complicated indoor spatial structure;received signal strength distribution;fingerprint matching;signal pathloss model;offline metric learning procedure;physical space structure;reasonable distance matrix;metric learning method;indoor localization accuracy;fingerprinting indoor localization;immense diffusion;RSS pathloss;distance metric learning;k Nearest Neighbor based indoor localization;Large Margin Nearest Neighbor","","2","","16","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ambient sound can be used by itself or in combination with other methods, like GPS, WiFi, etc. A way of identifying a place with sound is using ""fingerprinting"", which tries to match features of sound in similar places with the one being registered. Nevertheless, one of the many parameters in this process relates to the length of the audio both for the patterns and for the current recording. Several authors use a given time length (e.g. 10, 15, 30 seconds; however, they fail to provide any justification about the time length of the audio fingerprint for creating their classification models. In this paper, we propose to optimize the time length for classifying an environmental audio signal and for increasing the accuracy of the our classification model that uses support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier, and we perform an experimental evaluation. Our results show that the length of environmental audio signal should be between 30 and 40 seconds to get a model with 94.28 % of accuracy.","","978-1-5090-0079-1","10.1109/CONIELECOMP.2016.7438560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7438560","","Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Error analysis;Mathematical model;Vehicles;Time-frequency analysis;Oceans","audio coding;audio watermarking;signal classification;support vector machines","environmental audio fingerprint;place classification;environmental sound;ambient sound;fingerprinting;classification models;time length;environmental audio signal;support vector machine","","2","","18","","24 Mar 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This mode of cellular access has raised a lot of questions about use cases, enabling technologies, and fairness to other native unlicensed users, such as WiFi.

Recent popularity in smart devices, for example smartphones, has created an increased interest in carrying small devices with limited battery capacity. Unfortunately, smartphones are notorious for consuming energy far too quickly. Although certain advances have been made on the hardware side such as better batteries, this talk is focused on improving energy management software in the lower layer system to make better use of existing batteries. For modern smartphone, a major cause of battery drain is wireless communications. Most smartphones come equipped with multiple radio transceivers, such as Bluetooth, GPS, WiFi and 4G, among which power hungry WiFi or 4G radios are required for access to the Internet. The frequency of use of these radios is spurred by the popularity of smartphone applications, and many applications require the phone to be constantly connected to the Internet. The wide availability of applications, for instance the Android Market has over 700K registered applications, shows that the need to save smartphone radio energy is highly relevant and urgent today.","","978-1-5090-4338-5","10.1109/PERCOMW.2017.7917602","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917602","","","energy conservation;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile computing;power aware computing;smart phones","smart device system design;smartphone radio energy;network traffic aware approach;delay sensitivity;energy cost;performance based communication;application priority;machine learning;delay tolerant time periods;smartphone energy savings","","","","","","4 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
